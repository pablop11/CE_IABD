The black fruit flavors are touched up by notes of oak, dried cheese and leather—characteristics that extend onto the finish.",Selección Especial,89,62.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Pago de Sangara
13627,13627,Spain,"This reserva blend of Tempranillo, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon offers aromas of lead pencil and mossy berry.

13645,13645,Spain,"Woodsy and smooth smelling, with integrated spice and black-fruit aromas. It feels like a padded vise grip, with demanding tannins and blackberry, toast and coffee flavors that narrow down due to tannic astringency. Incredibly flavorful and potent; drink or hold.",Summa Varietalis Estate Bottled Syrah+Cabernet Sauvignon+Petit Verdot,90,30.0,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,,Red Blend,Marques de Griñon
13654,13654,Spain,"Smells roasted and stemmy, with a burnt leaf and turned earth quality to the bouquet. Herbal, scratchy berry and plum flavors feel rough and don't exhibit enough freshness. Simply put: it's a leafy, muddled Ribera wine.",Torre de Golbán Crianza,83,17.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Atalayas de Golbán
13658,13658,Spain,"Mealy and heavy smelling, but with decent background fruit aromas and sweetness. Frankly, this already seems to be past its prime, evidenced by creamy, flat flavors of bland fruit and caramel. The finish needs snap and crispness but doesn't have any; a bit too sweet, candied and bitter already.",,83,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Rosé,Borsao
13668,13668,Spain,"Heavy and nutty, almost like movie popcorn. In due time the nose transitions to creamy berry and cranberry. The palate is soft and muddled, with some citrus and red apple. Sweet and tomatoey on the finish; needs more focus, acidity and dryness.",Cabernet Sauvignon Rosado,83,20.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Rosé,Enate
13669,13669,Spain,"A bit sharp, stemmy and sour smelling. But the fruit flavors are solid and the herbal cherry and plum character that leads the palate improves with airing. Herbal on the finish; standard as a whole.",,83,11.0,Levante,Yecla,,Monastrell-Syrah,Evine
13679,13679,Spain,"This warm-climate Viura hits with plodding barrel aromas and flavors but there's not a lot of high-quality natural material to support that much faux/forced oak. Along the way it hints at mealy apple, spice, cinnamon powder and resin. A lot of noise but not much music.",Blanco,83,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Viura,Borsao
13785,13785,Spain,"Meaty leathery blackberry aromas are less dressed up and polished than in past vintages. This Mencía feels jammy, wide and chunky, while flavors of spicy blackberry are limited. A toasty oaky lightly charred finish closes out this full-bodied offering from a tough cool year.",,89,20.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Losada
13837,13837,Spain,"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak. The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry.

13850,13850,Spain,"Aromas of black fruits, light oak and violets are good but basic, and that pretty much defines the rest of the wine.

13852,13852,Spain,"A jammy, fruity, extracted Tempranillo with simple, candied berry aromas followed by a heavy, bulky palate that's packed with warm berry fruit.

13858,13858,Spain,"Nice and prickly, with aromas of nettles, citrus and minerals.

13897,13897,Spain,"Compared to the excellent 2006, this wine is heavier, riper and jammier at every check point. The nose is baked and raisiny, while the palate feels saturated to the extreme and gritty as well.

Give this lots of air after opening, about an hour or so.",Partida Bellvisos,89,130.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Gratallops
13898,13898,Spain,"Attractive and fruity on the front end, this has pure berry aromas but not a lot of nuance or complexity.

13958,13958,Spain,"Heavy aromas of orange marmalade and honey come across as unconvincing. The palate follows suit with bland, soft, chubby cantaloupe and green melon flavors. Finishes soft and dilute; seems like it's already dying in the bottle.",,83,13.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Vega Murillo
13960,13960,Spain,"Rough and leathery, with roasted black fruit and burnt-leaf aromas. The palate has a clacky, sharp feel and flavors of dried, baked berry fruits and leaves. Hard, roasted and leathery red wine.",Crianza,83,11.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,,Tempranillo,Viña Albali
13966,13966,Spain,"Lean raspberry and cherry aromas are the best part because the palate is rather raw and acidic, which causes raspiness and a tough mouthfeel.

13967,13967,Spain,"Expensive for what you get. The nose is a weird mix of salami and sweetness, and the palate is a syrupy, globular blend of cloying oak, caramel syrup and candied banana. Way too much wood and vanilla here, and not nearly enough balance or purity.",Blanc de Montsalvat,82,40.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,White Blend,Francesc Sanchez Bas
13971,13971,Spain,"Smells lightly burnt and acrid, with stemmy berry aromas, apricot and match stick. The palate has a flat, creamy feel and stemmy, dry flavors of generic berry and bitterness.

13986,13986,Spain,"Gets rolling with a blitz of dark berry, cedar, bramble and graphite aromas. It feels punchy for being a dark-style red, with meaty black-fruit flavors. On the palate, it turns juicier and more rugged as the acidity steps up, ultimately finishing thick but catchy, with peppery spice. A blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet and Merlot.",Juan de Albret Crianza,90,35.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Finca Albret
13993,13993,Spain,"This is floral and minerally on the nose, with notes of tobacco and bold berry. Feels structured and solid, with dark berry, carob and sweet mocha flavors.

13994,13994,Spain,"Smoky and earthy smelling, with aromas of tobacco, subtle spice and dried cherry. This feels tight, with more acidity than body at this point in its evolution.

Plump and broad, with good depth.",Isaral,87,46.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Prior Pons
14188,14188,Spain,"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp.

14289,14289,Spain,"Dusty, sweet and gummy on the nose, and not very vital. The palate is chunky and dull, with mealy white fruit flavors and a bit of fino sherry or manzanilla.

14295,14295,Spain,"There's a reason Airén is used as a base grape for brandy and Sherry wines, and it's because it's not up to table-wine quality, even at the value price point. This wine is corny and lacks freshness. It's dull, wayward and offers little to no structure. Barely drinkable.",Airén,80,9.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Airen,Sierra Virgen

14386,14386,Spain,"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry.

16379,16379,Spain,"The leathery red-berry aromas are a tad stretched and tight but still good.

16400,16400,Spain,"Rarely do you find musclebound, intense reds priced at $8 that are this good.

16404,16404,Spain,"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal.

16501,16501,Spain,"Blackberry, tobacco and balsamic aromas lean slightly towards vinegar, and there's a distinct tangy quality to the palate.

16992,16992,Spain,"With its black plum, blackberry and other bold, juvenile aromas, this bargain-priced Spaniard shows flavors of chocolate, natural bitterness and good overall balance.

19767,19767,Spain,"Smells slightly exotic and different from the norm; the nose offers baked black-fruit scents, lemon peel, rubber and Eastern spices.

19926,19926,Spain,"With aromas of moss, balsam wood, baked berry and earth, this is a complex, interesting Rioja that's overdelivering for $20.

20057,20057,Spain,"Intriguing but expensive sweet wine, with leather and dried cheese aromas as well as dusty, rubbery black fruits and licorice.

20726,20726,Spain,"Just sweet and soft enough to temper the wine's more citric, minerally side.

20764,20764,Spain,"Not a lot of glaring aromas of a sweet wine here; in fact, it's showing fresh tomato, cherry and more dryness on the nose than candy or syrup.

21834,21834,Spain,"Earthy and mildly medicinal smelling, with a healthy, not too stark palate that's dealing pointed cherry flavors and some dry oak. It's a touch sharp and angular, with a dry, peppery finish that's lean, acid-driven and starching.",Otoñal,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Olarra
21837,21837,Spain,"Smells oily, stemmy and a bit funky, while the palate is sweet in the extra dry mold, with candied white-fruit, vanilla and powdered sugar flavors. The finish is warm and sweet, with a fast fade. More candied and sweet than fruity or exact.",Aria Estate Extra Dry,84,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
21872,21872,Spain,"Quiet and shy on the nose, with generic white-fruit notes. For a medium-dry white, it offers requisite sweetness along with soft fruit notes, candied flavors and a green, lightly vegetal accent. A bit spritzy but not that lively or precise.",Fuente Milano,84,13.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Verdejo,Bodegas Escorihuela
21873,21873,Spain,"Grassy on the nose, and for a brut nature this is decidedly flat in aromas, with ultradry flavors of lime and tangerine along with powdery vanilla. Super light on the finish, which dissipates in no time. Almost tart and lacking in the long run.",Brut Nature,84,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Miquel Pons
21875,21875,Spain,"Blowsy and mustardy, like it's starting to turn south. The palate is loud, jumbled and heavy, with mustardy orange flavors, a touch of flowery honey and then bitterness. Big and powerful, but not very poised.",,84,17.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Robalino
21886,21886,Spain,"Tanning in color, with stalky, semimealy aromas that lack zap and citric crispness.

Pithy and bitter on the finish, like almond skins.",Old Vines,83,12.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Macabeo,Yasa
21889,21889,Spain,"Sweet and funky smelling, with a weird set of aromas that suggest Middle Eastern spice and hard-to-gauge fruit. The palate feel is barely acceptable, while the flavors are jumbled and overtly spicy and strange. Maybe it's the oak? Or maybe it's just not very good wine.",Crianza,83,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Qumrán
21940,21940,Spain,"A passionfruit-dominated wine without much else besides a fresh, almost watery palate feel.

21947,21947,Spain,"Based on experience, Zumaya's wines just aren't at the high level that Ribera del Duero is known for. This is herbal and foxy, with roasted, leafy aromas leading to an underwhelming palate of tomato, stewed red fruit and vanilla.

21974,21974,Spain,"Serious wine for serious Ribera lovers, even if it's from a generally weak vintage. Smells of bacon grease, graphite and dark berry fruits. Feels tight and youthfully tannic, with hickory, smoked meat, clove, toast and blackberry flavors. Clove and spice rest heavily on the woody finish; needs time to evolve and absorb its oak treatment. Best from 2013–2018.",Malleolus de Valderramiro,92,212.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
21978,21978,Spain,"Dark as night, with charcoal, campfire, sweet berry and jammy notes to the alluring bouquet.

22005,22005,Spain,"Heavy and mealy on the nose, with stalky white-fruit aromas. The palate is weighty and sticky, with a cloying feel and sweet, baked flavors of apple and honey.

22010,22010,Spain,"Smells like tarmac and tire rubber initially, and it remains stemmy and staunch even with air.

Fades quickly on the finish, which is probably a good thing.",Vendimia Seleccionada,82,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Conde de Jauregui
22028,22028,Spain,"Hard and crusty on first impression, with smoky, leathery, meaty aromas along with hints of wild herbs and dark berry fruit.

22058,22058,Spain,"Smells strange, with a mix of unknown spice and odd fruit aromas. The palate is snappy and sharp, with light fruit and oaky, resiny flavors that leave a lasting, confounding aftertaste. Rather pointless given all the good value-priced wines on the market.",Juan de Valdelana,81,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Valdelana

25185,25185,Spain,"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Crianza,88,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
25187,25187,Spain,"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs. Zesty, a bit lemony, and nice on the finish. Not a complicated bubbly by any means.",Brut Reserva,88,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Sonim
25195,25195,Spain,"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas.

25219,25219,Spain,"Solid on the nose, with pure berry aromas matched by oak-related vanilla. Fresh and medium in weight, with juicy acidity and mild tannins.

25235,25235,Spain,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Single Vineyard,88,18.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Finca de Arantei
25240,25240,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry.

25241,25241,Spain,"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger. The nose delivers still-fresh apple and mineral aromas, while the flavor profile leans toward gooseberry, lemon and green melon.

Shows good concentration and quality for a large-production bubbly at this price.",Aria Estate Brut,88,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
25261,25261,Spain,"Smells clean as a mountain stream, with apple, peach and mellow citric aromas. Shows medium intensity and controlled citrusy acids along with grapefruit, pineapple and passion fruit flavors that come largely from the 20% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend; the rest is 70% Chardonnay and 10% the local Picapoll grape.

25292,25292,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance.

25302,25302,Spain,"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Nora da Neve,88,29.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Nora
25310,25310,Spain,"For Navarran Merlot-Cab, Inurrieta Norte is always a winner. This vintage has good darkness along with smooth aromas of black fruit, earth, rubber and spice.

25508,25508,Spain,"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate.

25520,25520,Spain,"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal.

25522,25522,Spain,"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice.

25666,25666,Spain,"After an aromatic opening that includes wet leather, rubber and brine, this wine finds its stride, and while it's firmly tannic, the flavors of dark fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cured meats do the trick.

Lurton
26063,26063,Spain,"Lively, candied and medicinal, with grassy aromas along with mild animal notes. The palate is young, grabby, forceful but solid, while the flavors are bright, bold, snappy and suggest red plum and black cherry.

26110,26110,Spain,"A bit flat and jammy on the nose, and then it runs hot and heavy across the palate, where the flavors waver between citric and plum-cherry.

26118,26118,Spain,"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum.

26194,26194,Spain,"Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region.

26198,26198,Spain,"Bright and shimmers with purple, while the nose is jumpy and candied, with a lot of sweetness and black fruit.

39370,39370,Spain,"Warm and powerful stuff, with potent black fruit, latex and oak-driven vanilla aromas. Saturated and jammy, with oaky flavors of hard spice, blackberry, burnt toast and pepper. Feels a little hot and crusty on the finish.",Probus,90,30.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Volvoreta
39379,39379,Spain,"Begins with a full blast of toast and char, and then come notes of lemon, leather and rooty, sweet berry fruit. Borderline syrupy in feel, with heavy concentration and baked flavors of molasses and chocolate to go with blackberry. Seems a little over the top and stewy, but there's no doubting its ripe, round character.",Roda Reserva,89,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Roda
39386,39386,Spain,"Woodsy and rich smelling, with sous-bois, ample spice, ripe berry aromas and weight.

39427,39427,Spain,"Rich, smoky and heady, with earthy black fruit aromas that fold in mocha and vanilla.

39592,39592,Spain,"This is dark as night, with boysenberry, blackberry, animal fur and smooth oak aromas.

39595,39595,Spain,"Aromas of vanilla, stewed red berry, leather, cheese and heat indicate a ripe wine entering it's peak years.

39597,39597,Spain,"This unusual varietal wine hits with a giant wall of herbal aromas that suggest tomato leaf, oregano and basil. The palate is firm and structured in feel, with smacking tannins and flavors of dark berry fruits, green herbs and coffee.

Drink now.",Inspiración,88,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Maturana,Bodegas Valdemar
39640,39640,Spain,"For a higher-priced wine, this has some issues. The nose is heavy and murky, with leathery, baked aromas. In the mouth, it's somewhat choppy and acidic, thus punctuating the cherry tomato portion of the earth-and-leather flavor profile. Lingering oak accents the finish, which is zesty and leans toward sour.",Flor de Lasierpe Viñas Viejas,85,22.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Dominio Lasierpe
39647,39647,Spain,"Rusty in hue, with mature, slightly old aromas of leather, gym bag, dried leaves and mature berry.

Modest in its scope, but fresh and untainted.",Organic Wine,85,12.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo,Spartico
39680,39680,Spain,"Intense up front, with potent black fruit aromas offset by a lactic creaminess.

39970,39970,Spain,"Quite an oaky wine, with aromas of BBQ, hickory, roasted plum and spice. The body is full but scratchy, with additional oak manifesting itself in the form of baked, rooty, vanilla flavors that override the wine's simple but quiet fruit content.

39982,39982,Spain,"For an '04 reserva, this wine is more edgy, grabby and high in acid than expected. The nose shows old world leather, spearmint and smoked meat more than vibrant fruit, yet the palate is tangy, citric and tastes of red raspberry and plum.

40183,40183,Spain,"Leathery, stalky berry aromas are a bit rustic, and so is the feel.

40305,40305,Spain,"Almost red in color, with dusty aromas that mix in a blast of latex and dried cherry notes.

40312,40312,Spain,"A standard Riojano red with crisp cherry aromas followed by a zesty, slightly tart palate that carries punchy cherry fruit, acidity and little nuance or character.

40315,40315,Spain,"Slightly vinegary on the cherry-laden nose, with a mild but persistent briney character.

40532,40532,Spain,"Sweet and fiery on the nose, with piercing aromas that burn right up your nasal passages. The palate is pinched and super tannic, with biting flavors of black licorice, blackberry and cola. Could be better with a softer, smoother mouthfeel but seeing that this is an '04 with six years behind it, it isn't going to soften up much.",Gran Dama de Toro,84,45.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
40533,40533,Spain,"Smells a little too much like berry candy and cough syrup to win you over, and the palate is kind of flat and chunky as well as thick with creamy berry fruit.

40540,40540,Spain,"Quite candied and jumpy on the nose, what some might call bug juice.

Tastes much like milk chocolate and candied fruit.",Roble,84,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Protos
40543,40543,Spain,"Begins with pasty, lactic aromas and heavy fruit. The palate is both big and clumsy, with sharp acidity amid bulk leading to choppy plum and medicinal cherry flavors.

40550,40550,Spain,"Jammy, dark and reduced, with breadth along with leather and compost aromas. The palate is leathery, funky and medicinal, with viscosity and creamy berry flavors.

40556,40556,Spain,"Neon pink in color, with heavier aromas that split time between chemical and candied.

40558,40558,Spain,"Simple at best early on, with leathery, rustic aromas and a truly basic set of flavors.

40654,40654,Spain,"An oaky, modern-style wine with a staunch mocha and vanilla influence, but the fruit is ripe and rich enough to handle it.

40808,40808,Spain,"Muscular plum and black cherry aromas come with citrus peel and herbal notes.

40844,40844,Spain,"Fairly light and leathery, with strained aromas of animal hide and burnt berry fruit.

40852,40852,Spain,"Palacio Quemado, which means the Burnt Palace, is a funky wine from Extremadura that mixes forceful floral aromas with barnyard and grape juice scents.

41033,41033,Spain,"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity.

41034,41034,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with a jammy nose of berry fruit and coconut.

41037,41037,Spain,"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core.

41132,41132,Spain,"Starts with tough, almost harsh green aromas on the nose, but with time it settles on herbs and tobacco.

41133,41133,Spain,"Opens with vinaigrette and balsamic notes along with leather and black fruit aromas. The palate is soft and muddled, with soupy, stewy flavors and a jagged, candied finish.

41145,41145,Spain,"Sweet, plummy and unrefined on both the nose and palate. This is nothing more than simple juice that isn't terrible.

41155,41155,Spain,"Balsamic and hard, with a briney, stemmy set of chemical-tinged black fruit aromas. The palate hits with force and noise; it's hard, tannic and unforgiving.

41206,41206,Spain,"A little scratchy on the nose, but otherwise it exudes pure aromas of cassis and raspberry. The palate is juicy, racy and snappy but full and structured, while the flavors of raspberry, plum and blackberry get sweetness in the form of coconut and vanilla-infused coffee.

41293,41293,Spain,"Coconut and vanilla aromas ride front and center on the oaky nose, although berry fruit rises up with time.

41611,41611,Spain,"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors.

44201,44201,Spain,"Dark in color, with aromas of bacon fat, blackberry candy and vanilla. The body is medium to full, with grabby tannins that support mildly medicinal blackberry and cherry flavors. Finishes clean and regular, with no nasty residue or forced oak.",Codice,85,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tinto Fino,Dominio de Eguren
44206,44206,Spain,"A tutti-frutti nose leans toward candied cherry and red plum, while the palate is lean, a touch shrill and tastes of lightly herbal red fruits. Nothing heavy or weighty here; it's a simple, perfectly good everyday Rioja with a hint of oak.",,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Darien
44211,44211,Spain,"A rough, raw wine from Galicia that starts with a swirl of hard fruit aromas, heat and chemical. The palate is jacked up with berry fruit, tannic bite and power, and the finish is chewy and rugged. Packed with color and flavor but also aggression. Definitely not for everyone.",Barrica,85,23.0,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,,Red Blend,Abadía da Cova
44212,44212,Spain,"Neutral, clean, good white wine for the money. The nose features green apple and lemon, and the low-octane body shows brine, citrus fruit flavors and pithy notes. White grapefruit and orange flavors carry the simple finish to a good ending.",Mesta,85,7.0,Central Spain,Uclés,,Macabeo-Moscatel,Bodegas Fontana
44216,44216,Spain,"Light, simple and ready to drink. More acidic than some, with a cleansing, almost sour flavor package of green apple and lemon. Shows a lot of unabsorbed acidity on the finish, which forces the wine toward being crisp and minimalist. Drink now.",,85,18.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Pazo San Mauro
44411,44411,Spain,"Earthy, baked, raisiny aromas convey ripeness and sweetness.

Has good length and feel, with tomato and herbs on the finish.",Old Vines Gran Reserva,86,20.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
44446,44446,Spain,"Pure and forward, with minerally aromas of citrus, grapefruit and wet stone. For basic Verdejo, this is head and shoulders above most; it bursts with fresh orange, grapefruit, green apple and peach, and the finish is pure and long. So tasty and super easy to like; a highly recommended go-to value white.",,90,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Naia
44502,44502,Spain,"Peach, melon, apple and minerally aromas are easy to like. This has a standard Rías Baixas feel and moderate citric acidity. Flavors of melon and nectarine finish nice and a bit sweet. Call this textbook Albariño and enjoy it.",,88,17.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Mar de Viñas
44520,44520,Spain,"A barrel-heavy blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo? That's what this is, so expect popcorn and bland white fruit along with plenty of acidity. On one hand, it's an angular, sour wine that makes you wonder; on the other hand, it blends toast, butter, baked apple and lemon into a nutty whole that's not bad. Has both merits and faults.",Tríptico,85,25.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Verdejo-Sauvignon Blanc,Storks' Tower
44521,44521,Spain,"Light, floral and almondy, with hints of pear, apple and buttercup on the nose. More creamy and soft than acidic, with pear and vanilla flavors.

44527,44527,Spain,"Dark, fiery, forceful and woody, with aromas of sawdust atop black fruit. The palate is zesty, lively and hard, with biting tannins raising up flavors of blackberry and pepper. Acidic, rough and tough, but with good flavors and a decent amount of integrity.",,85,16.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,Volver
44546,44546,Spain,"Rubber and bacon aromas announce that this wine has some size, depth and concentration along with oak shadings, while the palate is fruity, acidic and tangy, with generic berry flavors and an added dose of oak-driven bacon and rubber. Solid at first and then thin on the finish.",Tinto Figuero 4,85,15.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
44549,44549,Spain,"With good fruit and controlled aromas, it does what young Toro should when done well. Tight in the mouth, with bold black cherry flavors, it bites down with young, big tannins, but it doesn't burn or grate. Shades of mint and chocolate help it along.",Bajoz,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Pagos del Rey
44708,44708,Spain,"A simple quaffer with lime, pineapple and minerally aromas. It's light and easygoing, with a dilute feel and tropical flavors of mango, lime and apple. Lasting and fairly juicy on the finish.",Blanco Vendimia Seleccionada,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Bodegas Muriel

44726,44726,Spain,"After wading through some burn and heat on the nose, things settle on basic red fruit.

Feels racy, slick and quick on the finish.",,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Castillo Clavijo
44758,44758,Spain,"A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.",Cenit Old Vines,90,48.0,Northern Spain,Tierra del Viños de Zamora,,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
44820,44820,Spain,"Rooty, tough aromas are brambly, while the palate is narrow in feel, drying and tastes of herbal raspberry and cherry. Quite snappy and a little sharp, with a quick finish of red fruit, tomato and zest. Could improve with aging, but at this point the wine, while solid, seems lacking in stuffing.",Reserva,85,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
44823,44823,Spain,"For a Ribera rosé, this gets it mostly right. The nose is neutral and standard, while the spunky palate sports good acidity and flavors of strawberry and raspberry. Wet and refreshing on the finish, and good overall.",Rosado,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Recorba
44824,44824,Spain,"Smells a bit cheesy and sour at first, and soon after oak and mild berry fruit take over. On the palate, it's dry, peppery and grabby, with solid but common plum and raspberry flavors. Tomato notes and herbal flavors come up on the finish, but all together it's a good but regular Ribera wine.",Vendimia Seleccionada,85,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Resalte
44836,44836,Spain,"For a Priorat red, this is lean and snappy, with hot, stemmy aromas and light-bodied, racy fruit flavors. It's a blend of six different grapes, and overall it comes across just well enough to be worth a go. That said, it is kind of short and scratchy given its domain.",,85,15.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,La Ninota
44839,44839,Spain,"Dark in color but a bit hot and clunky on the nose, where oak-based vanilla helps mask its true identity, which is choppy and tart. In between the wine's tang and zest, there's moderate sweetness, vanilla and mild wood notes stemming from the five months it spent in barrel.",,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Paramo de Corcos
44849,44849,Spain,"A touch stalky on the nose, but after that it gets things mostly right. The fruit aromas and flavors are subdued, with jammy raspberry notes leading the way. There's no overt burn or grating feel, and that's good with inexpensive, niche-filling concept wines like this. Fine if you're expectations are modest.",,85,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Merlot,Tempra Tantrum
44954,44954,Spain,"Yellowing and leesy in character, with a deep, brooding style.

Tasted twice with consistent notes.",,85,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Fillaboa
44962,44962,Spain,"A crusty smelling wine with aromas of crude oil, roasted nuts and modest berry fruit. Feels acidic and scratchy, with balsamic flavors and a chalky finish.

44969,44969,Spain,"Perfumed, chunky and almondy on the nose. Feels full and oily but also a bit juicy, with driving, penetrating orange and grapefruit flavors.

44998,44998,Spain,"A high level of purity from the start. The bouquet attracts with strong scents of mineral, flowers, wild herbs, berry fruit and toast. There's no shortage of bracing acidity, so the body weight and balance are just right. One of Spain's most food-friendly, elegant wines, and not run of the mill. The best expression of Mencia on the market today.",Villa de Corullon,92,45.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Descendientes de J. Palacios
45068,45068,Spain,"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet). Finishes a little sweet and warm, and thus it's begging to be drunk now.",Àn,89,50.0,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
45077,45077,Spain,"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",Crianza,89,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Valserrano
45088,45088,Spain,"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes.

45098,45098,Spain,"This is a particular style of barrel-aged Verdejo that displays aromas of cured ham, fennel and not much fruit. This has creamy weight on the palate. Flavors of oily white fruits, nuts and charcuterie finish in a blaze of funky flavors, texture and residual oak.

45161,45161,Spain,"Pop the cork and look for a bulky Mencía from the little-known region of Ribeira Sacra in Galicia.

45164,45164,Spain,"Smells earthy, leathery and a bit gaseous before you get to a broad palate of stretched berry flavors, vanilla and herbal notes.

Improves a bit with airing but still it struggles to make the grade.",LZ,85,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Telmo Rodríguez
45167,45167,Spain,"A simple but pleasant Ribera red with berry-cherry aromas. The palate has a staunch, tannic grab to it as well as flavors of raspberry, black plum and earth. A wine that has o.k. length and solidity to the finish.",Tinto Roble,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
45169,45169,Spain,"A heavy, briary wine that opens with a full blast of earthy compost and burnt leaves. The palate features pointed berry fruit along with a wall of oaky coconut and vanilla.

45176,45176,Spain,"Woody and dried out, with oak-based spice and burnt elements on the bouquet. The palate is gritty and acidic, with tart, limited, earthy cherry flavors.

45184,45184,Spain,"This wine costs a lot for what it's giving. The nose starts out hard and fruitless, and while the aromas come around, the wine always holds onto its corn and haystack character. Zippy acidity gives the mouth zest, and it also livens up papaya, banana and apricot flavors. Complex and different, but does it taste good enough to justify a $78 price tag?",Kyrie,88,78.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,White Blend,Costers del Siurana
45194,45194,Spain,"Starts out stewy, with exotic spice aromas that are uncommon but not unpleasant. That unusual spicy character persists throughout, and the feel is chewy and meaty while the fruit veers toward stewed blackberry, nutmeg and anise. A different breed of cat but a good one nonetheless. Drink now.",Agnus de Valdelana Reserva,88,53.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Valdelana
45256,45256,Spain,"Tropical and forward, and with three months spent in oak, the wine offers some resin and vanilla both on the nose and in flavor.

45260,45260,Spain,"Flowery and sweet smelling, then round and fairly smooth in the mouth. The bubbles and flavor package of tropical fruits galore is pleasant and shouldn't offend anyone.

45311,45311,Spain,"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit.

45320,45320,Spain,"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas.

45322,45322,Spain,"Very solid and sturdy, with aromas of apple, lemon-lime, soda cracker and mineral.

Dry, pithy and hinting at complexity on the finish.",Reserva Heredad,89,25.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
45326,45326,Spain,"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla.

45361,45361,Spain,"Minimum was impressive wine in 2003 and it's better in 2004. Cambra's blend of 70% Monastrell and 30% Cabernet Franc is probably the best wine coming from the obscure Valencia D.O. It is generous, balanced, rich and lusty; flavors of blackberry, cassis and plum are succulent and every hole or gap seems filled by tannin, flesh and flavor. Drink now through 2011.",Minimum,92,75.0,Levante,Valencia,,Red Blend,Bodegas Rafael Cambra
45422,45422,Spain,"A bit jumbled early on, and then more open and minerally. The palate is chunky but hollow, with melon and green fruit flavors.

45426,45426,Spain,"Initially, lemony aromas and flower notes stir interest, while the palate has a medium-to-full feel and pumped-up melon and floral flavors.

45438,45438,Spain,"Smells like red licorice nibs and stemmy, candied fruit, while the palate is medium bodied, reasonably well balanced and juicy, with berry and plum flavors.

45441,45441,Spain,"Dark, bulky and fairly oaky for a wine of modest DNA.

An average wine on its best day.",Solnia,84,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ilurce
45485,45485,Spain,"A clean, dry, green-fruited wine that's juicy, citric, tangy and features pure orange, lemon and lime aromas and flavors.

45594,45594,Spain,"This may appeal more to some than others because barrel-fermented Viura is a tough row. Smells a lot like creamed corn or wheat, with apple cider on the side. It's barely acidic enough, thus it's soft in feel and tastes of butterscotch, melon and flabby apple. Seemingly less interesting than in the past.",Fermentado en Barrica,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Finca Nueva
45599,45599,Spain,"Starts out heavy and roasted, with herbal, earthy berry aromas settling in.

45667,45667,Spain,"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy.

45672,45672,Spain,"Sappy green apple, grapefruit and citrus aromas are welcoming and pure, while the palate is soft-edged, citrusy and full or tangerine and melon flavors.

45681,45681,Spain,"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy.

45720,45720,Spain,"Sweet, candied, oaky aromas get it going, and the palate, while tannic and tough, is thin in its midsection.

45747,45747,Spain,"Catchy name but the wine is basic. The nose is lightly candied with a bit of green and brine.

45988,45988,Spain,"Yellow in color, with a waxy nose that's baked, rich, a bit stalky but also honeyed.

Good as you're likely to find among Spanish Chardonnay.",Colección,88,20.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Chardonnay,Viñas del Vero
45990,45990,Spain,"The nose on this Garnacha Blanca is funky and blends aromas of cured ham and salami with lees and citrus. The palate feels right, with solid acidity.

46023,46023,Spain,"Candied fruit and punch bowl aromas are not what you'd call sophisticated, and the mouth pretty much follows suit with tart, rubbery raspberry fruit that comes on a bit hot and raw. Tough but with full flavor; sort of like chewing on a plum skin.",,84,12.0,Galicia,Ribeira Sacra,,Mencía,A Fuga
46031,46031,Spain,"Lean, dry aromas of cherry skins and citrus lead to a competent but basic palate of raspberry and cherry flavors.

46034,46034,Spain,"Vivid pink in color, with dusty, easygoing raspberry aromas. The palate is a bit soft and low in acidity, which indicates that this is the year to drink the wine...and as soon as possible. Flavors of cherry and strawberry are regular, if a touch bitter toward the finish.",Rosado,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Casita Mami
46038,46038,Spain,"By no means is this the best wine from Pedrosa; it has decent red berry aromas, but what you really get is minty, forward oak.

More barrel than substance here.",Crianza,84,,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Pedrosa
46040,46040,Spain,"Minty-grassy top aromas indicate that the wine, while endowed with decent berry character, has an herbal side as well.

Basic with a touch of sourness.",6 Meses en Barrica,84,12.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Melior
46047,46047,Spain,"Opens with a blast of hot, basic red fruit that's fiery and a little pickled. The palate is lean and acidic but doesn't burn, while the cherry and red plum flavors are elementary.

46074,46074,Spain,"Opens clean and friendly, with bacon, cassis and plum aromas. The palate is round, fairly large and pure, with tasty black fruit flavors that are sweet, ripe and throw off a bit of licorice. Finishes long, with brown sugar and a hint of toast.

46156,46156,Spain,"Aromas of oil and almond skins leave things in a neutral state. Feels heavy, round and fleshy, with mealy apple and spice flavors. Feels soft, weighty and pithy on the finish. Lacks the vivacity that Verdejo is known for.",,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Viore

46271,46271,Spain,"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors.

46276,46276,Spain,"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas.

46289,46289,Spain,"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors.

46290,46290,Spain,"Same score as the prior year, and pretty much the same wine. It's dusty and slightly burnt in aromas and flavors, with banana, peach and pithy bitterness extending onto the finish.

46293,46293,Spain,"Saucy and jammy initially, and then a raisiny quality takes over. Plump and thick in the mouth, but ultra jammy in terms of mouthfeel.

46301,46301,Spain,"Disappointing given Telmo Rodriguez's overall track record. Dehesa Gago 2008 is jumpy, sweaty and stemmy smelling, with weedy, burnt, acrid flavors.

46304,46304,Spain,"Fairly green, a bit oxidized and old smelling. The palate is short and choppy, with hard leftover tannins and dry, herbal fruit flavors that push up against vegetal.

46335,46335,Spain,"Clean and smooth to open, with a hint of salinity, powdered sugar and peach. The palate is sheer and zesty, with lemon, green apple and tangy acidity. Crisp yet angular on the finish, but good in a narrow, lean, drilling sort of way.",,87,18.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,La Val
46344,46344,Spain,"A snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor.

46345,46345,Spain,"Clean, simple and very much in the style that has made Las Brisas a go-to value white.

46509,46509,Spain,"Abnormal by white wine standards, with oily aromas of smoked meat, air freshener and exotic spices. Feels flabby but also dilute, with just enough verve to keep it alive.

46535,46535,Spain,"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope.

46541,46541,Spain,"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas.

46545,46545,Spain,"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice.

46555,46555,Spain,"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas.

46608,46608,Spain,"Hard, leathery aromas, with an intense but exceedingly tannic palate. Killer bite and raspy, with bitterness and heat. Has decent black fruit flavor but still it's tough and unrefined.",Tres,82,18.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Liberalia
46619,46619,Spain,"Stemmy, pickled aromas send the fruit component to second fiddle. Tastes, smells and feels like a wine that didn't get fully ripe; the flavors are thin and light, with tea and dilute berry. Finishes same as above.",,82,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Gazur

There's telltale grapefruit and stony aromas in front of a pure, easygoing palate endowed with grapefruit, passion fruit and tangerine flavors. Still, it's not overly citric or one-dimensional; excellent Verdejo with a little extra in terms of refinement.",Fuente Elvira,90,17.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
49813,49813,Spain,"Dense and roasted on the nose, with tobacco, leather, mild herbal notes and blackberry fruit.

Drink now through 2014.",Especial Reserva,90,40.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
49824,49824,Spain,"One's level of passion for this bulky, hefty Mencía will be largely based on one's appreciation and/or acceptance of heavy oak. The nose is pure hickory, molasses, mocha and coffee, while the chewy, ripe palate deals clove, flowery notes and blueberry flavors. Finishes big and broad, with bacon and barrel resin. Beefy and from the barrel as much as the vineyard; drink now through 2015.",,90,48.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Mencía,Avanthia
49825,49825,Spain,"Very clean and clear, and even though it's a 2009 it is still holding onto its core freshness and character. White fruits and flower blossoms work the nose, and the palate is now fully mature, elegant and smooth. Flavors of peach, melon and kiwi are clean and tasty. Albariño at its best.",,90,30.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Lusco
49870,49870,Spain,"Spearmint, bramble and tomato aromas give this wine a mature bouquet. The palate is wide and shows standard leather, berry and tobacco flavors. But it's also a bit tannic, with chocolate, coffee and a grabby feel working the finish. Pleasant and good as a whole, but by no means an overachiever.",Reserva,87,41.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Paramo de Corcos
49871,49871,Spain,"A greeting of toasted nuts and toffee is lifted and sweet, and the palate is quite sweet, with orange marmalade and cinnamon-infused syrup flavors. The finish teeters on cloying as it packs a sweet punch, but there's enough acidity to keep it moving along. Best if you like sweet Sherry.",Medium Amontillado,87,13.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Pedro Romero
49882,49882,Spain,"Sweet with brown-sugar aromas, but the nose lacks more than that.

Standard; not designed for complexity.","Medium, Rich Oloroso",86,13.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Pedro Romero
49883,49883,Spain,"Hard and closed on the nose, but if you dig there's saturated yet generic dark-fruit aromas and a touch of creamy, lactic oak.

49927,49927,Spain,"Smells like air freshener and white flowers. The palate is spongey and a bit low on life, while the flavors lean toward citrus but lack purity and zap, which is further drilled in on the waxy finish.

49948,49948,Spain,"Light on fruit but loaded with mocha and milk chocolate aromas.

50019,50019,Spain,"A little old school with its dill and vanilla aromas and flavors, but with leather, raisin and berry accents and a nice medium-deep body, it more than gets the job done.

50025,50025,Spain,"The Crespiello grape isn't one you see often, but it yields a deep, dark style of wine with balsamic notes, fresh black-fruit flavors and weight. This one is almost on the side of cooked, but not quite, thus it blazes a path with blackberry, smoked meat, jerky spice and more. A touch flat but not flabby.",Crespiello,87,52.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Crespiello,Pulchrum
50071,50071,Spain,"Heavy, dark, candied and jammy, with a hint of licorice to the nose. The palate is chunky and concentrated, with meaty berry flavors and a dose of chocolate. Short on the finish, yet fruity if a bit flat.",Spada,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Fariña
50131,50131,Spain,"Full, dark and dense, with blackberry, molasses and bacon on the nose. At first it seems modern and new-wave, but the palate isn't fat and overextracted; instead it's zesty, vibrant and deals pugnacious blackberry flavors topped with spice and chocolate.

50136,50136,Spain,"Quite impressive and eyebrow raising for Graciano. The nose is smoky and dry, with raspberry and bacon. In the mouth, acidity is controlled and thus there's no sourness to the plum, tomato, spice and vanilla flavors. Finishes with verve and elegance; a nice potential partner for just about any food.

50137,50137,Spain,"Heavy, oily and well oaked, but also elegant, elevated and something out of the ordinary. This is barrel-fermented Viura at a high quality level; it's smooth, creamy and lifted but also acid-rich and lemony, with notes of toast, vanilla, melon and wood resin.

50142,50142,Spain,"Unlike TG's Abadía de San Campio Albariño, this wine also features Loureira and Caiño Blanco, and it's more interesting in the long run.

50181,50181,Spain,"Mature and sound on the bouquet, but more snappy and sharp overall than you might anticipate for a 2001. Aromas of tobacco and bramble lead to flavors that you'd expect: more tobacco, dried plum, sour cherries, etc. Long and lean on the palate and finish, with pulse but a shortage of richness.

50187,50187,Spain,"Despite the high price and small quantity (125 cases total), this wine is not performing at an optimal level. The nose, based on 32 months in oak, is drying and minty, with more dill and leather than fruit.

53352,53352,Spain,"If basic Argentinean Torrontés is to your liking, so will this be. It's fresh and green on the nose, with melon and lychee aromas.

53574,53574,Spain,"One taste and you can see the correlation between this Priorat dry PX and certain fino-style Sherries. It's nutty and dry as a bone, with almondy aromas.

It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side.

54586,54586,Spain,"Not bad on the nose, where strawberry and cream aromas are doused a bit by a burnt-field smell.

54589,54589,Spain,"Pleasant but very basic, with a nose of dry cherry and a palate that's crisp, lean and features flavors of tart plum and cherry.

54590,54590,Spain,"Starts out on shaky ground with coconut and chemical aromas. In the mouth, it hits very hard with cola, raisin and cherry flavors.

54592,54592,Spain,"Roll out the barrel, or the staves, or the oak dust, or whatever it is that gives this modest Chardonnay such an overpowering wood element.

54593,54593,Spain,"Stemmy and rough out of the blocks, with aromas of rubber and strawberry.

54599,54599,Spain,"With tobacco, licorice, herbs, bell pepper and carob, there's a bit of everything to this Navarran Cabernet. The palate is thick and chewy, but it's also sticky and very tannic.

54726,54726,Spain,"Ripe, jammy, berry flavors are fruity, with a roasted overtone.

54750,54750,Spain,"A bit neutral for Verdejo, yet the wine's clean orange, tangerine and lime flavors are appealing.

54757,54757,Spain,"Maybe it's already late in this wine's lifespan but the nose has a corny, overly mature set of aromas that fail to convey freshness.

54776,54776,Spain,"Nice, simple and still showing staying power for an '09. Tastes of white stone fruits and melon, and shows body and adequate acidity.

54910,54910,Spain,"Neutral smelling, with a hint of pool water to the nose.

54994,54994,Spain,"This barrel-aged Viura shows the upside of what is normally a pretty ordinary grape variety.

55054,55054,Spain,"Leafy and smoky on the nose, with a firm, crusty topping. The palate is driving but has sheering acidity, while the palate shows blazing cherry, plum and tomato flavors.

55055,55055,Spain,"A lot of toasty oak on the nose announces this wine's barrel-fermented roots, and additional lemon and apple aromas are classy.

55102,55102,Spain,"Dark, ripe and handsome. Those are the basics on this showy wine. Aromas of leather, shoe polish and char darken up the berry fruit, while flavors of blackberry and plum vie with oak-based mocha.

55902,55902,Spain,"Stony lime and apple aromas are a proper set up to a balanced, racy palate. Flavors of dried apple, tropical fruits and pithy bitterness finish with white pepper notes and purity.

55951,55951,Spain,"Rubber, smoke and a bit of char combine to give this Garnacha-Graciano blend a hard exterior. The palate is reasonably round, with roasted berry flavors.

55953,55953,Spain,"Yellow in color, with a peachy, baked set of aromas.

Rounder and softer on the finish, but also short.",Blanc Selecció,86,15.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,White Blend,Huguet de Can Feixes
55959,55959,Spain,"Perfectly good for a 70,000-case product. It's bright on the nose, with fruity aromas of orange and tangerine. The palate is properly acidic, with lemon and more mild citrus flavors. Solid on the finish; makes the grade for $10.",,86,10.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Emina
55963,55963,Spain,"Spunky raspberry aromas give this Tempranillo-led blend a fresh bouquet. The palate is snappy, a little high in acidity, and plenty zippy, with plum and cherry flavors.

55969,55969,Spain,"Unusual aromatics for Ribera include minty blueberry and something suggesting metal and chemical. The palate is better despite smack-down tannins and briary raspberry flavors.

56004,56004,Spain,"Deep in color for an '01, with sweet aromas of vanilla, tobacco, leather and hickory.

56516,56516,Spain,"Very nice red wine but for $112 we want to be forced to take notice, and frankly that doesn't really happen here.

56868,56868,Spain,"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Ladera,82,21.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Algairen
56869,56869,Spain,"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Vertus Crianza,82,15.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo

56888,56888,Spain,"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish.

56898,56898,Spain,"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable.

56899,56899,Spain,"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it.

57196,57196,Spain,"There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy.

57408,57408,Spain,"Standard as good brut Cavas go, with yeast, citrus and a hint of matchstick on the nose. The palate shows a good fabric comprised of lemon-lime and apple flavors.

57410,57410,Spain,"Tea, floral and black cherry aromas give this aging wine some character. The palate has held onto its darkness, thus plum, blackberry and coffee flavors are in charge.

57761,57761,Spain,"This blend of six vineyards is great. It's dense and full of minerality, finely polished leather and pure berry aromas. The palate sings a melodious tune that begins with creamy oaky notes and expands to more defined plum, vanilla and fine herb flavors.

58035,58035,Spain,"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache. It's fruity to the max, with aromas of boysenberry and black cherry as well as similar flavors. Ripe and easy to drink.",,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,El Circulo
58037,58037,Spain,"Dusty and neutral on the nose, with a hint of wild flower and mineral to stir interest. The palate is dry despite having some size and plumpness; flavors of apple, peach and papaya are crisp and lean.",Estate Bottled Dry,85,13.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Muscat,Sumarroca
58040,58040,Spain,"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Blanco Fermentado en Barrica,85,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
58046,58046,Spain,"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables.

58055,58055,Spain,"Very dark for Mencía, which indicates that it is an old-vines wine of pedigree. The nose is composed of cigar box, licorice gumdrop, balsam wood and berry fruit. In a word it's hedonistic, and the richness and full-bodied berry and plum flavors may just bowl you over. It's definitely more oaky than many, but it still qualifies as Bierzo at its most bountiful.",Tares P.3,92,90.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
58063,58063,Spain,"Rock-solid Tempranillo that wows with its richness and depth, but also shows a touch of ripeness-based sweetness that critics could see as candied and simple. But that's splitting hairs, and we prefer to compliment the wine's dynamite intensity and its rangy finish. Maybe a touch bigger and less complex than Fournier's AlfaSpiga, but still excellent.

58068,58068,Spain,"A swaggering, slightly traditional holdover from the amazing 2001 vintage. This wine delivers cumin, pepper, turned earth and vanilla-infused berry aromas in front of a juicy, forward, complex palate featuring prime red-berry flavors along with hints of red pepper flake and tobacco. It still shows ample oak and vanilla but the fruit quality, tannins and structure can handle it. Drink now–2015.",Manuel Quintano Reserva,92,56.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
58247,58247,Spain,"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more.

58273,58273,Spain,"Heavy char and cedar aromas sit atop green-leaning black-fruit scents.

58281,58281,Spain,"Rubber, cured meat and herbal berry aromas feed into a tomatoey palate with raw acidity and rough tannins.

Fresh yet soft, simple and easygoing.",Carta Nevada Brut,86,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
58302,58302,Spain,"Good but basic wine from southern Spain that shows cherry aromas with a citrusy twist.

Good for those who don't want to think much about what they're drinking.",,86,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Red Blend,Borsao
58313,58313,Spain,"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",,86,17.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Dom Bardo
58314,58314,Spain,"A little cloudy and minty, with aromas of herbs and reeds bumping up against cherry cough drop.

58315,58315,Spain,"Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas. And that isn't exactly a full-out compliment. So while the wine has balance and structure, the oak seems dominant on the nose and palate, which lends more vanilla and cream than spice and character.",Crianza Selección,86,16.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Red Blend,Borsao
58316,58316,Spain,"Quintessential value wine from Spain is what you're getting with Viña Borgia's 100% Garnacha.

58321,58321,Spain,"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out.

58324,58324,Spain,"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive.

58332,58332,Spain,"Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh.

Yes, it's still a tannic behemoth with a ton of new oak, but under all that bluster there's wonderful Tinta de Toro blackberry, licorice and tobacco flavors.

58664,58664,Spain,"An excellent Verdejo from Rueda is as good as fresh, crisp white wine from Spain gets. And the two Victorias that make José Pariente know their stuff.

60194,60194,Spain,"As pink wine goes, this Tempranillo-Merlot is extremely forward, heavy and aggressive. The nose is loaded with raspberry and cherry aromas, but there's also alcoholic heat reflective of its 14.8% alcohol.

60206,60206,Spain,"Torres claims to be serious about Ribera del Duero, but early on the Celeste wines, made from purchased grapes, are so-so at best.

Needs some fine tuning.",Celeste,84,22.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Torres

60216,60216,Spain,"Starts shy, but then reveals a smoky nose of dried cherries and freshly fallen leaves.

60392,60392,Spain,"Leather, baked berry fruit and coffee make up the nose, while the palate is tight with cherry, raspberry and zesty acidity.

Quick on the finish, with a revisiting of the wine's mineral component.",Alma de Blanco,88,15.0,Galicia,Monterrei,,Godello,Pazo das Tapias
61176,61176,Spain,"Broad and rubbery, with ripe black fruit and citrus peel on the nose. Good on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel. And the finish is   attractively marinated, offering hints of soy sauce, molasses and sea salt. Fresh enough, and definitely forward in thrust.",Reserva,87,34.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Valenciso
61178,61178,Spain,"Chunky and ripe, with more power and potency than precision or finesse. Which still means it's pleasant, warm and tasty. The   palate offers ample raisin and toffee, while the finish is aptly spicy. Good heft and texture, but short in the midsection.",Crianza,87,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
61179,61179,Spain,"Looks good in the glass, and smells pretty nice despite a hint of barnyard. In addition, there's cola, vanilla and plum to consider. Fairly meaty in terms of feel, but not overly expressive and not quite reaching the upper echelon. Finishes with some gritty, hard-fighting tannins.",Crianza,87,31.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Páramo de Guzmán
61187,61187,Spain,"Leathery and maturing, as the fruit seems to be on the fade. Dry cherry and raspberry notes carry the aging palate, which is bolstered by ample vanilla. Finishes warm, with licorice and pepper notes. Likable and more traditional, but drink soon.",Reserva,87,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Bodega Jario
61193,61193,Spain,"Quite hard on the nose, with classic petrol aromas that almost smell of rubber cement. Tough and tight on the palate; it takes some effort to penetrate. Once inside there's crisp apple and lime zest. A true “nature” in every sense.",Reserva de la Familia Brut Nature,87,20.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps
61197,61197,Spain,"Plump and fruity, with aromatics of tobacco, leather and dark fruits. Features sweet, sturdy black cherry and plum flavors before a finish of warm earth, plum and vanilla. Very straightforward in its approach, but solid on all accounts.",Crianza,87,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
61198,61198,Spain,"A bit of brett and barnyard on the nose, with minty raspberry coming on to take over. A little leafy on the midpalate, but not what you'd call green. Bitter chocolate carries the finish. A blend of five red grapes, a couple of which are local and virtually unknown.",Marboré,87,34.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Red Blend,Bodegas Pirineos
61246,61246,Spain,"A touch grassy and raisiny at first, but soon it gets into step and shows cleaner, fresher spice and cherry notes. For an average vintage, this is a nice wine with pepper, mildly jabby tannins and lots of oak. With air it settles nicely, and with food it should make for a good partner.",Selección,88,39.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Estancia Piedra
61249,61249,Spain,"Hard smoke and raspberry aromas are balanced and pure, and the mouth is ripe, juicy and bright. This makes its point with subtlety and smoothness. It's not a bumpy, aggressive wine as it holds its balance all the way to the end.",Roble,88,14.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Abad Dom Bueno
61254,61254,Spain,"Nice Albariño, no ifs, ands or buts. The nose is floral and clean, and that's backed by a no-fuss palate of citrus, namely orange and grapefruit. As it holds form from front to back, you know this is a good wine. Will go great with light salads and shellfish. Drink immediately.",,88,12.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Nessa
61261,61261,Spain,"Floral and lighter bodied, with attractive red fruit aromas and a modicum of exotic spice. The palate is tight, pure and a little sharp and pointed, while the flavors are of flashy, zesty raspberry. A juicy wine that treads lightly rather than with a hammer.",C21,88,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Cepa 21
61263,61263,Spain,"Leafy and spicy, with notes of paprika, tomato, dried leaves and broth. But in the mouth, it's fresh and vital, with good balance and flavors of dried cassis, tobacco and herbs. For an older wine from industrial Valdepeñas it's doing a good job. But now is the time to drink it.",Gran Reserva,88,15.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,,Tempranillo,Anciano
61264,61264,Spain,"Smoky and dry, with aromas of tire rubber and mildly herbal, leafy red fruits.

Finishes nicely, with berry fruit at first and then herbal, oaky afternotes.",,88,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Arrocal
61271,61271,Spain,"Dark and very toasty, with espresso, bacon and roasted black fruit aromas. Tight and drying in the mouth, with biting tannins, a lot of oak and finally mildly herbal flavors of blackberry and burnt toast. Hard and dark, but big and boisterous, with a blatant barrel influence.",Abuela Cleofé,88,50.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Paramo de Corcos
61276,61276,Spain,"Leather, tobacco, citrus peel and herbs make for a controlled bouquet that doesn't smack you in the face. The body, however, is tannic and grabby, while the flavors of sweet berry carry a roasted angle and a dash of spice. Chocolaty and spicy on the finish, but again it goes down hard and tannic, which is a drawback.",Reserva,88,70.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Resalte
61282,61282,Spain,"Very sweet and rich, and probably a little too much so for some folks. Aromas of cassis, berry liqueur and black fruit candy are sweet, sweet, sweet, but after the sugary richness subsides you do get a dark, brooding, mammoth Garnacha with prune, chocolate and baked power. A 15.5% heavyweight to drink before 2011.",Atteca Armas Old Vines,88,45.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca
61396,61396,Spain,"Alluring bubby, regardless of origin or composition. The bouquet is dry, clean and spicy, with crushed raspberry.

Imported by Jorge Ordoñez Selections.",Rosé Brut Reserva,91,25.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
61474,61474,Spain,"Seems a touch green and stripped at first, but airing brings it around. Still, there's a lot of fresh wood and resin, which somewhat masks the plum and berry fruit that's eager to emerge. Spicy on the finish, with a decent feel.",,86,19.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,Clos Dels Coduls
61482,61482,Spain,"Meaty on the nose, with chunky leather aromas along with mature fruit. In the mouth, it's a touch racy and acidic, which serves to bolster its raspberry and pie-cherry personality. Pretty good overall, with a sizable allotment of zest.",Reserva,86,47.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza
61485,61485,Spain,"Lean on the bouquet; there's almost zero yeast or lees character. But there is an interesting smoked-meat aroma that conjures memories of sausage or ballpark franks. Aggressive in the mouth, with green herbs and paprika. An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.",Aniversario PA 84 Brut Nature,86,70.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Parxet
61486,61486,Spain,"Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums. A lot of dryness comes out on the palate, courtesy of starchy tannins and medium-weight red fruit. Finishes with grip, size and a heavy hand. For best results, give it as much time as you can.",Elite,86,55.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
61487,61487,Spain,"Saucy and mildly seductive, with aromas of herbs, leather and exotic spices. In the mouth, however, things seem a touch rustic and burnt. The palate carries some serious zing and spice, but to call it smooth would be a stretch.",Gran Reserva,86,30.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
61495,61495,Spain,"Fat and melony on the nose, with tons of pear, cantaloupe, almond and vanilla on the palate. Heavily oaked, especially on the finish, where wood resin is mostly what you get.",Vinya Gigi,86,29.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Chardonnay,Jean León
61498,61498,Spain,"Riper and deeper than some in this class, but arguably overoaked and roasted, such that the finish tastes like burnt coffee and the bouquet smells of peeled tire rubber. In between look for plum, blackberry, cumin and black pepper.",Crianza,86,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
61499,61499,Spain,"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage.",,86,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Valdubón
61505,61505,Spain,"This starts with a strong blast of black olives, leather and blackberry, followed by condensed fruit flavors and a tinge of black cherry. A nice wine with character, but for $80 it comes up short of thrilling.",Paredinas,88,80.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Estancia Piedra
61513,61513,Spain,"All in all this is a perfectly good wine. But in this pricey class and category we get picky, and we're finding some reduced, raisiny aromas and a slightly flat, edgeless mouthfeel. However, we do like the wine's berry and plum core and its intensity; too bad it's not more evenly balanced.",Cerrado del Castillo,88,75.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Castillo de Cuzcurrita
61515,61515,Spain,"Dense and fairly earthy, with a big coating of chocolate and char courtesy of full-force oak. The palate is dark and heavy with blackberry fruit, compact tannins and some burnt notes, while the finish is a little salty but long. Not stellar but showing a lot of qualities.",Estate Bottled,88,54.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Alma de Tobia
61520,61520,Spain,"Rich and a bit syrupy on the nose, with pepper and black cherry notes that keep things moving along.

A stocky wine that's ready to drink now or over the next few years.",Gran Reserva,88,35.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
61560,61560,Spain,"Opens with black fruit aromas, dry oak and spice. The palate shows an oaky creaminess, sticky tannins and solid berry fruit flavors that are matched and maybe even trumped by buttery oak. A little dry and drawing on the finish, but still a very nice RDD.",,88,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro
61569,61569,Spain,"A black wine with aromas of graphite, molten earth and black fruit. The palate is a pounder with strong tannins and blazing acidity, and that creates a mouthfeel with grating intensity and roasted black fruit flavors. Lively late, with herbal notes and a lasting tannic bite. At over 15% alcohol, there's a lot of fire and toughness, so hold for a few more years and hopefully the tannins will soften.",Reserva,88,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
61579,61579,Spain,"Flowery and fresh, with a bit of talc and creaminess to the bouquet. A little soft in the mouth, but still wet and likable.

61583,61583,Spain,"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",,88,14.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Lícia
61629,61629,Spain,"This smooth, stylish wine is on the way up, as evidenced by the two-point bump it's receiving from its last review, in December 2004. Today it's round and full, with aromas of hay and popcorn that draw you in. Layered through the middle, with expressive white fruit, dryness and sweetness all in one. Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Brut Reserva Privada,90,15.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Marques de Monistrol
61721,61721,Spain,"Bulky and ripe, with raspberry and punch-like aromas. If you like sweet notes like kirsch, sugar beets and coulis, this has it. Clearly the wine reflects the hot vintage, so it's soft, chewy and bent on sweetness. Good, but not an ager.",Tinto,86,9.0,Catalonia,Catalonia,,Red Blend,Mas Marçal
61723,61723,Spain,"A bulky, fruity style of cava that begins with aromas of floor polish, fruit essence and roasted corn. Shows much more citrus in the mouth, where the flavors run toward orange juice, lime and tarragon. Crisp and apple-based late, but never exciting enough to stir fandom.",Extremarium,86,16.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
61726,61726,Spain,"Typically amber in color, with aromas of dried cherries merging into apricots. Tangy and sharp on the palate, as is standard.

61733,61733,Spain,"Extracted and raw, but with enough rustic country charm to make it worth a go. Four major grapes were thrown together, yielding cherry, beet and tomato aromas.

61734,61734,Spain,"Shows hickory-style wood aromas along with jerky, briar patch and cherry. Fairly fresh and forward, with a tangy palate dealing standard berry-cherry fare.

A cut above the mass-market products; quite acceptable for the price",Roble,86,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
61802,61802,Spain,"Clean, pure and a touch slight, but fine in terms of minerality and zest. This is nice with lots of melon, lemon verbena and almond notes.

61808,61808,Spain,"Molasses, saddle leather and black olive aromas add complexity and masculinity to the bouquet, while flavors of black cherry, roasted plum and vanilla fit correctly into the wine's meaty, firm style.

61821,61821,Spain,"Crisp, green and friendly, with aromas of celery and fairway grass.

61831,61831,Spain,"Minerality is a major player in this peachy white blend that throws off some salinity and pool water on the nose.

Fresh and melony on the finish.",Vendimia Oro,88,36.0,Galicia,Ribeiro,,White Blend,Bodegas Docampo
61832,61832,Spain,"Colorful and fresh, with a bit of latex/Band-Aid on the nose to go with bacon, raspberry and oak-based maple aromas.

61836,61836,Spain,"Slightly earthy and herbal, as Somontano reds are prone to be, with a gritty mouthfeel and sweet black fruit flavors that come with proper herbal accents.

61845,61845,Spain,"Clean, solid aromas of black cherry and berry are just what you want from Spanish Monastrell, and while this isn't the most unique or original wine, it sure is tasty, balanced and pleasing. Flavors of lightly baked black fruits are lush, while the finish is medium-long and easygoing. Hard to find anything wrong with this affordable red from Alicante.",La Tremenda,88,11.0,Levante,Alicante,,Monastrell,Enrique Mendoza
61855,61855,Spain,"From Freixenet, this is perfectly good yet familiar, which for $15 is about as good as we can expect.

61987,61987,Spain,"Exhibits dry red fruits and mushroom on the nose, with accents of forest and spice. Somewhat minty and forward on the palate, and arguably a touch gritty and sweet.

62001,62001,Spain,"Not a bad little quaffer. From Martinez-Bujanda, this colorful, ripe red is solid and chunky, with sweet aromas of berries and black plum.

62082,62082,Spain,"The nose of red fruits comes with oak, mocha and toast, while the palate is crisp and tight, with juicy, dry red berry flavors and backgroud notes of chocolate and spice.

62086,62086,Spain,"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits. The acidity is a bit pronounced and scouring, but that only means that the citrus and green apple flavors cut and cleanse. Juicy but modest when it comes to depth of flavor. Drink now.",,87,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Valmiñor
62096,62096,Spain,"A bit rubbery and earthy, with compost, smoky bacon and black fruit aromas. Nicely balanced with a good mouthfeel, and showing solid berry and plum flavors.

62221,62221,Spain,"Light as if it were even older than it is, but nicely perfumed and mild in scope.

Best if you don't expect too much from it.",Crianza,85,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Zitua
62223,62223,Spain,"A bit sweet on the nose, with notes of caramel, blackberry and earth. Better at first, where it comes on ripe. But then it turns a little sluggish and heavy as it opens. Still, it's largely a good Rioja, maybe more in the “modern” style than old-school.",Reserva,85,24.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Origin
62230,62230,Spain,"Rich and creamy, but lacks zest and drive. The nose and palate offer sweet banana and oak, while the feel is almost too pillowy. Tastes more like a dessert than a dry white should.

62238,62238,Spain,"More minty oak than fruit on the nose, with simple but clean candied fruit flavors. A bit short on depth and complexity, but totally drinkable, especially after some airing.

62309,62309,Spain,"Earth, leather and mildly stewed aromas greet you, and right away one can tell this wine came from a warm vintage. It has integrity and depth but maybe it still couldn't escape what 2003 threw at it. Why do we say that? The acidity seems higher than normal, maybe because of early picking, and it lacks the pure-pleasure quotient that we look for in higher-priced Bierzo wines.",Daniel,87,50.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Luna Beberide

Where it does well is in texture, which is correct and pleasant. Finishes long and heavy. A different breed.",Brut,85,11.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Torre Oria
62466,62466,Spain,"Earthy and ripe, with jammy, borderline stewy fruit that carries a meaty edge. Fairly one-line in terms of complexity, but it stands on its feet and tastes pretty solid. With some rustic character, it'll do the job.",50th Aniversario Sangre de Toro,85,10.0,Catalonia,Catalonia,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Torres
62474,62474,Spain,"If it seems dirty at first, time will reveal tobacco and leather aromas along with black plum and coffee. Seems more sour than you might expect, with pie cherry and rhubarb flavors. Really high-toned on the finish, where it teeters on the brink of sour. Not bad but not endearing.",Reserva,84,27.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
62475,62475,Spain,"Tons of color but the nose is a bit soupy, with aromas of heavy oak, black fruit, tomato and herbs. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that's solid but shrill. Hits with extract and tannins, but the integration and flavors don't quite achieve the next level.",Tinto,84,20.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Red Blend,Care
62478,62478,Spain,"Plump and a bit stewy, but the flavors manage to take over in a fairly positive way. Upon sipping you take in blackberry and prune, but also some murkiness. Not much in the midpalate, but decent around the edges.",Crianza,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Valcortes
62479,62479,Spain,"Muddled to start, with chocolate and earth aromas along with heavy, seemingly chewable berry fruit.

62503,62503,Spain,"Hints of peanut and caramel vie with mineral and acacia blossom for center stage on the nose, while the palate deals nut skins, lime, kiwi and gooseberry.

62510,62510,Spain,"This is a nice, traditionally styled Rioja. Delivers smooth, earthy, leathery aromas and then spicy dry fruit that's right out of Rioja 101.

62527,62527,Spain,"A recommended entry-level Ribera, with aromas of violets, minerals and oak.

62679,62679,Spain,"A Monastrell with 10% Cabernet, and it is heavily minty and woody, with leaner than expected fruit and a whole lot of resin and vanilla setting things off.

62682,62682,Spain,"Some heft and richness propel this bargain wine to a higher level. There are even some bacon, beef and leather aromas in addition to the plump fruit scents.

62697,62697,Spain,"Nice in terms of texture, but a bit strange and hard to identify as far as aromas and flavors go.

62706,62706,Spain,"A blend of 65% Merlot with 35% Tempranillo;  the nose offers olive, black plum and a touch of resiny young oak.

Plump and broad, with good depth.",Isaral,87,46.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Prior Pons
62758,62758,Spain,"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp.

62889,62889,Spain,"Black in color and saturated with plum, fruit cake and vanilla aromas. Big in the mouth but clumsy, with dense, thumping black cherry and blackberry flavors.

62894,62894,Spain,"A little heavier than ideal, with a touch of raisin along with candied black cherry on the bouquet.

62914,62914,Spain,"Full to the tipping point, with sweet aromas of pears and peaches. Is it over done? Maybe a little, but in between the folds of very ripe fruit there's some mineral and citrus pith. Bottom line: the funky blue bottle catches your eye and the wine is fine.

63107,63107,Spain,"The color and mouthfeel on this modern-styled, expensive Rioja are both very nice. On the palate, it's cushioned and healthy, with smooth tannins and proper acidity.

63525,63525,Spain,"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors.

63526,63526,Spain,"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth.

63528,63528,Spain,"This new wine from the Torres group is a little heavy and baked on the nose, but once you get it onto the palate there's depth, mouthfeel and solid flavors of savory fruit, soy, rubber and dark berry.

63640,63640,Spain,"Typical of many 2002 Riojas, this packs a punch but doesn't hit many high marks.

63646,63646,Spain,This is a nice little Viura (with 15% Chardonnay) that smells nutty and smooth and tastes of tangy citrus and other white stone fruits.

63837,63837,Spain,"Dry and piercing on the nose, and then crisp and snappy on the palate. For those opposed to overextracted, heavy reds, this could be up your alley.

64203,64203,Spain,"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes.

64495,64495,Spain,"The number of good, even palatable, varietally bottled Gracianos is small. This is typical of what you usually find: lean flavors, spiky acidity and even a chemical burn to the nose.",Viñedo No. 7,81,15.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Graciano,Señorío de Sarria
64497,64497,Spain,"A wine in discord. The nose shows raisiny P.X. Sherry hints, while the palate is underdeveloped and tart. Shallow and almost too sour.",Leyendas de Vega Esteban Crianza,80,12.0,Central Spain,Ribera del Guadiana,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Ventura De Vega
64499,64499,Spain,"Acceptable, but barely. There's a strange citric, grassy tinge to the nose that makes it smell like Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. And it tastes pickled and briny. Decent mouthfeel and sensory balance save it from even lower depths.",T-Sanzo Rosado,80,10.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo,Valsanzo
64519,64519,Spain,"Shows yeasty, earthy, dusty aromas, with just a slight trace of fruit. There are also mild fruity flavors.

64537,64537,Spain,"A bit strange smelling for Rioja in that the nose deals a mix of candied berry aromas along with stemmy, herbal, compost notes. The palate is thick and chewy, while the flavor profile includes lightly baked, creamy berry and roasted accents. Stocky and fruity but with issues.",Cortijo III Tinto,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Cortijo
64551,64551,Spain,"Starts out with gassy, earthy aromas that suggest heat and barnyard, while the palate is chunky and full, with stemmy black cherry, plum and berry flavors along with coffee and chocolate accents. Delivers power and length but not much in the way of character or complexity.",Auroch,84,12.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
64554,64554,Spain,"A mix of standard berry fruit and leafy, herbal qualities is the starting point. Next up is a tangy, acidic palate of red fruits, vanilla, acidity and ultimately some bitterness. Short and gritty on the finish. Tastes and smells like mass-market Bordeaux. A blend of 60% Tempranillo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon.",Rívola,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo Blend,Abadia Retuerta
64579,64579,Spain,"Light and lemony, with a hint of green astringency. Tangerine with hints of mushroom on the palate run toward a solid but lean finish. Has zest but little roundness.

64583,64583,Spain,"Not every wine is easy to read: this one is a case in point.

A funky bubbly that's worth a try.",Cuvée Dessert Dulce,86,20.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Pinot Noir,Parxet
64601,64601,Spain,"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing.

Proof that wines do change over time, and that sometimes we underrate the youngsters.",,91,57.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Pago de Larrainzar
64609,64609,Spain,"A forward wine with earthy aromas, leather and a hint of Navarra's herbal essence. The palate is full-bodied and complete, with balanced weight and tannic structure.

64622,64622,Spain,"Very red in color, an ominous indicator of what's to come. The aromas are close to raisiny and baked, while the palate sort of lugs along.

64660,64660,Spain,"Licorice, pepper and raisin join forces on a can't-miss bouquet that's all Monastrell and all southern Spain. Dark and candied, with tons of cooked brown sugar.

One glass we can recommend; two or more might be tough to handle.",Dulce,86,24.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Bodegas Silvano Garcia

64717,64717,Spain,"Hot, earthy aromas settle on leather and tomato, while the palate is gritty and tastes of dark, smoky, chunky black fruit.

64720,64720,Spain,"Warm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped.

64721,64721,Spain,"Stemmy and leathery smelling, with heat, roasted fruit and cheesy aromas. The palate is full but soupy, with roasted, baked black fruit flavors.

64726,64726,Spain,"A little burnt and leathery smelling, with stem, bramble and raspberry aromas.

As a whole, there isn't a lot of substance here to weigh.",,83,9.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Viña Paquita
64739,64739,Spain,"Clearly this isn't a vintage for long keeping. In fact, one of our usual favorite Ruedas is already on the downslide.

64764,64764,Spain,"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors.

64850,64850,Spain,"With its dried-cherry and rose-petal aromas and flavors, this beautiful, mature red is every bit the equivalent of a fine, older Bordeaux or Burgundy.

64855,64855,Spain,"Deep, sweet dark-cherry fruit forms a solid foundation for this impressive wine.

64857,64857,Spain,"Beautifully balanced, this shows all the positive attributes of mature Rioja.

64876,64876,Spain,"Nothing special about this blend of Tempranillo and Shiraz. In fact, it's more austere and less pleasing than the brand's basic 2007 Temp-Shiraz blend.

64878,64878,Spain,"Cherry and mild sawdust aromas are brought down by sharpness that is almost vinegar-like.

64897,64897,Spain,"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack.

64917,64917,Spain,"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much.

64956,64956,Spain,"Avinyo does not make cookie-cutter cavas, and thus this wine is out of the ordinary and not always the better for it. The nose is lean and spritzy, with aromas equal to lemon-lime.

65026,65026,Spain,"While this wine doesn't really appeal to us, we can envision fans of Old World, leaner, more acidic wines signing on.

66240,66240,Spain,"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing.

66353,66353,Spain,"This Rioja rose displays a full bouquet of rose petal, spice and the slightly meaty element that Tempranillo so often shows.

66390,66390,Spain,"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic.

66410,66410,Spain,"Earthy black cherry aromas give this easygoing Rioja an honest and true nose.

66584,66584,Spain,"Round, mossy and deep smelling, but austere in the mouth. A berry and plum flavor profile is infused with tomato and herbal notes, while the finish is long, healthy and cleansing.

69118,69118,Spain,"Is it (MS) or the wine? This vintage of Cáceres rosé seems o.k., but nothing more than a splash across the palate.

69139,69139,Spain,"Dark mineral, toasted French oak and black fruit carry the nose. This is a sturdy, nicely made high-end Rioja, but due to the heat of the year its range of flavors is narrow as it settles on baked plum and molasses.

69242,69242,Spain,"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much.

69275,69275,Spain,"Stylish and alluring nose; quite sexy. The malolactic fermentation took place in barrel, so the wine has mouthfeel and richness.

69428,69428,Spain,"Blackberry and cola are the prime aromas that comprise the alluring bouquet. And as you'd expect, there's also leather and spicy wood thrown in.

69598,69598,Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate.

70182,70182,Spain,"A little tight and reticent, but airing reveals aromas of raisin, marzipan and earth.

70222,70222,Spain,"Lots of bacon, leather and earth coat the nose of this vanguard-style Rioja, but unlike the spectacular 2001, the '02 is not nearly as deep and ethereal.

70279,70279,Spain,"A good effort in a tough year, and frankly we're happy that Muga decided to make a reserva in 2002. The wine shows lean aromas of dried red fruit, tomato leaf and dill. In fact, dill is a recurring theme from front to back. And along the way there's acids, red cherries, plums and currants. Good but leaner than a normal Muga effort.",Reserve,87,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
70280,70280,Spain,"Early aromas of leather, rubber and char sort of shadow the fruit component. But in the mouth there's ample blackberry, cherry and pepper, all of which bring the wine into form.

70306,70306,Spain,"Mature but not even close to expiring, with cola, root beer, tree bark and leather on the bouquet. Fairly acidic, which is why it has so much verve at 10+ years.

70347,70347,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so.

Has a lot going for it; drink now through 2012.",Cartoixa,91,52.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Scala Dei
70544,70544,Spain,"A genuinely attractive, well-made old vines red with earthy, minerally aromas along with violet petal and blackberry. The palate has a fine feel to it, depth and complexity, while flavors of dry berry and baking spices work wonders. Dry, pure and long on the finish, and really quite excellent for a vino de tierra. Drink now through 2014.",Dominus Gran Selección Viñedos Viejos,91,50.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo Blend,Yllera
70565,70565,Spain,"A throwback Rioja that sports tobacco, mulch and some true Old-World aromas that make you question the wine's health. But airing breathes life and tilts it toward dried cherries. Finally you discover core power hammered home by hard tannins, sharp acidity and an odd nuttiness. Not a wine for all tastes.",Reserva,86,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Dominio de Conte
70573,70573,Spain,"As always, this gracious white wine made from the Viura grape delivers the goods. In this case, it's pineapple and pear aromas in front of pleasant apple and fresh celery flavors. There's even some honeyed apple to the finish. Light, liquidy and never bad when served properly chilled.",,86,7.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
70589,70589,Spain,"For unafflicted plum and berry character, this young, fresh Rioja has the goods. The sweet berry and cherry palate is at peak drinking condition, and the finish runs longer than expected courtesy of a beam of bright acidity. A wine with Zinfandel-like charm. Imported by Pernod Ricard USA.",Crianza,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
70592,70592,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on. Impressive depth of flavor, nice overall balance and a mix of complexity and flat-out richness make this PX a winner.",Nectar Dulce,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
70601,70601,Spain,"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,91,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
70608,70608,Spain,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,59.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
70609,70609,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful. Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Solera 1847 Oloroso Dulce,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
70616,70616,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",El Belisario,91,80.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
70621,70621,Spain,"Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors. But as that fruit sits and the acidity builds, the wine goes racy initially and then almost haywire. By the end it almost falls off toward sour. Best right out of the bottle, and with food.",Crianza,85,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
70624,70624,Spain,"As per usual, this wine carries a leafiness and peppery quality that runs ahead of its fruit quotient. That doesn't mean it's a poor wine; but it emphasizes dry oak and saucy flavors as opposed to richness and ripeness. Best for Rioja traditionalists and those who might drink it with robust foods.",Finca Monasterio,85,43.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Baron De Ley
70643,70643,Spain,"Aromas of cherry sucking candy, sangria and citrus peel are easy and clean but not what you'd call sophisticated. The palate is forward and basic, with tangy cherry and plum skin flavors. It thickens a bit on the finish but always has a racy personality. Better with food due to grabby tannins and acids.",Reserva,85,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
70648,70648,Spain,"Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking. The wine has color and potential, but the nose is a little flat and syrupy. The palate delivers ripe dark fruit flavors but also a touch of medicinality. Balance can be fleeting and this wine doesn't have it all the way.",Reserva,85,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Solabal
70651,70651,Spain,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Cristina Oloroso Abacado,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
70667,70667,Spain,"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Lot 129,90,15.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
70676,70676,Spain,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011.",Crianza,90,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Solabal
70689,70689,Spain,"A standard but solid Tempranillo is what you're looking at. The nose pushes red fruit and some American oak aromas like pickle and dill. The feel is fresh and young, but also a little fleshy and substantive. Finishes friendly and smooth.",,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Darien
70696,70696,Spain,"Perfectly nice, but ultimately basic in its approach. The nose is initally dry and woodsy, with plenty of balsam. Later on, the palate reveals a previously unseen black cherry element, while the finish is crisp and lean. Drink now.",,85,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
70703,70703,Spain,The kick and acidic foundation of this crianza work in its favor. They balance some of the heavier elements and emphasize the berry core and also the finish. Is it narrow and limited? Yes. But it fits the traditional mold and doesn't disappoint.,Crianza,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,El Coto
70708,70708,Spain,"Spicy and reedy in an old-fashioned way. This wine represents traditional Riojano winemaking: it's tight, acidic and endowed with racy rhubarb, raspberry and dill flavors. Pretty full and big on the palate, with touches of green herb and spice on the finish.",Reserva,85,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
70713,70713,Spain,"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors. It has plenty of body but keeps its balance, and the finish is thick and strong. A little rugged but really good by regional standards.",Lot 128,90,15.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
70715,70715,Spain,"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit. Not super spunky and lively, but dense as a brick and interesting. Drink now through 2014.",Torre Albéniz Reserva,90,50.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
70724,70724,Spain,"Ripe and attractive, with deep red fruit aromas. The palate is intense and thorough, with solid tannins supporting ripe, natural flavors of baked berries, particularly blackberry and dark plum. Subtle and smooth on the finish, with length. The blend is 50% Garnacha and 25% each Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now through 2013.",Castell de Falset,90,40.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,Agricola Falset-Marca
70725,70725,Spain,"A potent, concentrated sort of wine with minerally, crusty aromas, smoked meat and black fruit.

Best now through 2012.",Reserva,90,36.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Alidis
70730,70730,Spain,"Bold, dark and handsome, albeit a touch herbal and earthy on the nose. The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper. Chewy, deep and ultimately dry on the finish. Drinkable now; best in another couple of years.",Gran Reserva,90,53.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
70740,70740,Spain,"CUNE is a throwback bodega whose wines won't appeal to followers of the new wave. And since I consider myself a backer of the modern style, I found this wine too obtuse, funky and borderline dirty to rate higher. It's full of mossy, stewy flavors and the feel is heavy. Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.",Imperial Gran Reserva,84,60.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,CVNE
70743,70743,Spain,"This wine is not up there with the bodega's top bottlings. It's rather sweet and soft, with mildly green and minty aromas. In the mouth, there's size and power but also a strong medicinal overtone that dampens the fiesta. In the end it's big and fruity but there's no sense of path or purpose.",Crianza,84,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Consejo de la Alta
70744,70744,Spain,"Lemon-lime and ginger ale are the opening aromas, while the palate carries green melon and passion fruit flavors. Not terribly intense or complex, with a cider-like spritz to the mouthfeel and finish.",,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,El Coto
70757,70757,Spain,"Vanilla, raisin and carob aromas announce a level of heft and overripeneness that is never lost or compensated for. It's a jammy, soft, well-aged specimen that doesn't have much life or kick. It does offer ripe, sweet berry flavors, however, and some molasses.",Gran Reserva,84,38.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
70762,70762,Spain,"Raisin, licorice and sawdust are the primary aromas, while the palate runs dry and slightly overdone with oak.

70783,70783,Spain,"An easygoing but nicely made Rioja that delivers purity, good fruit, body and feel. The nose is all cherry and berry, and it's a clear step up from your everyday red wine. The palate is medium bodied, with tasty, spicy flavors of cherry and raspberry. Lasting on the finish, with proper texture throughout.",Finca Vallobera,90,32.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Vallobera
70816,70816,Spain,"Oak, cherry and raisin make for a warm bouquet, and there's initial weight to the palate. But then grabby tannins and cutting acidity take over, pushing the fruit toward zesty, even thin. A light and ready style, for certain.",Gran Familia,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Castillo de Fuenmayor
70832,70832,Spain,"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors. It's no softie courtesy of heat and acidity, and at all points it mixes its sweet side with tough, roasted intensity. Great for cigar smokers.",Drysack Solera Especial Sweet Old Olorosso Aged 15 Years,90,25.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Williams & Humbert
70853,70853,Spain,"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee. For the price point this is right on the money; it's ripe but also really good and ready to drink.",Crianza,90,16.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
70869,70869,Spain,"Red cherry, cough drop and a touch of mushroom work the nose, while in the mouth it's crisp and pointed, with light red fruit and citrus-influenced flavors. A lean, lithe wine very much in the pie cherry realm.",Crianza,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
70870,70870,Spain,"This semisweet white can come across likable or awful, depending on your mood and the shape of the bottle you're drinking.

70922,70922,Spain,"Right from the start you know this wine is challenged. The nose is lean and green, with hints of tea and citrus peel. In the mouth, it's snappy and traditional, meaning there's American oak dill notes brushing up against rhubarb and red cherry. Proponents will cite its “classic” character while others will call it thin and not very rewarding.",,83,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
70926,70926,Spain,"Spearmint and untamed wild berry aromas start it down a slope that ends with a palate that's hot and heavy with fruit but devoid of balance and touch. There's a lot of this and that, namely vanilla and oak. But overall the wine just gets it together.",Crianza,83,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Rioja Vega
70929,70929,Spain,"Cheerful but basic raspberry aromas and flavors is what this young Rioja is about. It feels a little bulky at first, and then acids swell up to cut it short. Almost snappy in the late innings.",,83,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Rioja Vega
70931,70931,Spain,"This wine is not typical of Allende. It suffered from the heat of 2003 and thus it's overtly aromatic in a prune-like way and out of balance on the palate. If it weren't for the unusual but intriguing molasses aromas and the occasional blast of quality berry fruit, we'd dismiss it outright. Better to wait for the 2004.",,83,27.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
70937,70937,Spain,"An attempt at high-end Tempranillo that comes across rough and tough and not too friendly.

But where this wine gets you is in feel: it's a tannic monster.",Finca los Meriños,83,60.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Luberri
70965,70965,Spain,"Opens with rooty, mature aromas of tobacco, baked berry and raisin, while the palate is full and roasted, with sweet baked-plum and brown sugar flavors.

70997,70997,Spain,"Stewed fruit aromas with some baked beans on the side just isn't alluring, and the lean, raw, acidic palate that some might describe as traditional isn't clicking in my book. Saving graces include milk chocolate on the finish.",Reserva,82,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
71002,71002,Spain,"An earthy style with pickle barrel and leather on the nose. Dark berry flavors are muddled, and there's an odd twinge of citrus to the flavor profile. Never really gets it going and seems murky. Two samples tasted.",Don Roman,82,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marques de Tomares
71017,71017,Spain,"A dry, oily, piquant Oloroso that's more peanutty than almondy. The palate is racy due to no shortage of acidity, and the flavor profile is led by a salty, briney almond and leather character. Sheer and serious, with not a sugar cube in sight.",Alfonso Oloroso Seco,89,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Palomino,González Byass
71033,71033,Spain,"A bit heavy and raisiny, but with that said there's no denying the wine's richness and ripeness. Lush and dense in the mouth, with cocoa, roasted fruit and a mild syrupy lean to the flavor profile. Sweet but a little short on the finish, and condensed. Drink now through 2012.",Tinto Figuero 12 Crianza,89,29.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
71042,71042,Spain,"Never let the price tag dictate perceived quality; you may be disappointed. This tart, choppy, clumsily extracted Tempranillo is a case in point. Where's the balance and mouthfeel? This is why we blind-taste; save your $350.",,81,354.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Contador
71053,71053,Spain,"We are big fans of most Sierra Cantabria wines, but this fading, overoaked white Rioja is more or less a dud.

It's hard to see the point. 250 cases made.",Organza,80,24.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Sierra Cantabria
71057,71057,Spain,". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009.",,96,85.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Vall Llach
71074,71074,Spain,"Earthy and crusty at first, with smoked meat, black fruit and dryness to the nose. The palate is well formed and proper, with dry raspberry and mild chocolate flavors.

71091,71091,Spain,"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas. Good in the mouth because it's not gritty, but very sweet on the palate, with honey, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. If sweet is your thing, then add a point or two to our score.",Esnobista Moscatel Pasa,88,20.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
71097,71097,Spain,"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic. On the down side, it's residue-heavy and tannic, with full extraction and tannic berry fruit. Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",,88,90.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Paixar
71098,71098,Spain,"Opens with rich aromas of raisin, licorice, black plum and molasses that put it on the cusp of overripe. The palate is rich and gritty, with deep berry and molasses flavors.

71099,71099,Spain,"Raspberry and plum aromas carry a mild floral, perfumed accent, while the palate is medium in weight, with good flow due to lively acidity.

71104,71104,Spain,"Deep and dark, this is an excellent kitchen-sink blend (it includes Carignan, Merlot, Cabernet, Garnacha and Syrah).

71110,71110,Spain,"Lovers of full-bodied, extracted Priorat wines know Vall Llach, and that cult sees Embruix as a good value. The 2004 is on the right track: the nose is almost impenetrable as it oozes blackberry, tar and fine leather. Meanwhile, the palate is like warm berry compote followed by espresso and dark chocolate. Very rich although not overly complex. Best now with steak or cheese, or hold until 2008.",Embruix,92,34.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Vall Llach
71113,71113,Spain,"A barrel buster, with huge barrique qualities including char, chocolate and vanilla along with ripe black-fruit aromas.

Hold a couple of years to let it settle, then enjoy.",Amadis,92,60.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Rotllan Torra
71115,71115,Spain,"Powerful is almost an understatement in describing this big boy. The nose starts out fiery and rough before settling to intense. It's all guns blazing on the palate, where tight, racy raspberry fruit holds court. With intense oak and a molten core generating 15.5% alcohol you may want to tread carefully. The ride is not for the weak. Garnacha with Carignan, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon.",Melis,92,90.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Cellers Melis
71128,71128,Spain,"Carignan and Grenache lead the way on this old-vines classic that is typically excellent but not quite as generous, round and whole as in previous vintages. Still, you will be impressed by the compact nose of thyme, sage and tobacco along with dry red fruit. In addition, the palate of cassis and blackberry is pure and tannic as a rock.

71135,71135,Spain,"Radiator dust, baked apple and other familiar, semirich aromas grace the nose on this more elevated Cava.

71146,71146,Spain,"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit.

71169,71169,Spain,"One of the best efforts we've tried from Jumilla, Luzon's luxury blend starts with coconut, mint, char and fudge, and below that is a treasure trove of deep black fruit.

71171,71171,Spain,"This younger-vines mix of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah is very attractive and loaded with graphite, schisty mineral and black cherry aromas.

71196,71196,Spain,"A bit sweet and raisiny on the nose, but also dense and powerful. The palate runs rough and tannic, but there's enough richness and extract to allow for that.

71240,71240,Spain,"After a couple of rough years, all Fluminus needed was the good 2004 vintage. And the result is splendid. This blend of Cab, Garnacha and Carignan is pure as can be, with polished leather and fine tobacco aromas entering the fray. The whole is complete and big-boned, but in the end it's more tight and compact than plush.

71249,71249,Spain,"Rustic fruit aromas led by the native Samso grape cause a stir, and the wine, which also has Garnacha, Cabernet and Merlot, carries forth in the mouth, where lush blackberry and plum flavors are supported by healthy, spicy, minty oak.

Drink now through 2013.",Finca Monasterio,88,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
71264,71264,Spain,"A touch gritty and baked on the nose, and that ripe character persists throughout this semimodern Ribera wine. Along the route there's raisiny notes, baked plum flavors and oak-driven vanilla and spice. On the finish, vanilla is the lasting flavor. Solid and oaky, with some pushy coconut.",Reserva,88,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Valdubón

71293,71293,Spain,"Sweet, succulent aromas draw you in and while the wine doesn't deliver much nuance on either the nose or palate, we can't quibble with the power, purity and intensity of the blackberry fruit.

71337,71337,Spain,"This muscular youth proves that Priorat can deliver fleshy, modern wines. Or maybe it's the 20% Merlot that's softenening the Garnacha and Carignan.

71353,71353,Spain,"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range.

71388,71388,Spain,"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider.

71393,71393,Spain,"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character.

71416,71416,Spain,"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper.

71421,71421,Spain,"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes.

71454,71454,Spain,"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal.

71460,71460,Spain,"Generally speaking, this is a respectable Priorat from a tough year. The nose is berry packed, while the flavors run toward toast-covered raspberry.

71512,71512,Spain,"In 2005 this winery got a great harvest, and it's evident in this ripe, clean Garnacha that hits with jammy aromas and a ton of fresh-fruit flavors.

71518,71518,Spain,"Heat from the 2003 vintage aside, this is one sweet, forward, dark-colored Cava. The nose is all about cheeky, sweet fruit, while the palate offers more berry sweetness along with vanilla. Normally this bottling is more restrained and striated, but 2003 was a warm year. May be better with desserts than appetizers, given the ripeness.",Rosé Brut Reserva,87,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Llopart
71520,71520,Spain,"Nothing wrong with this pleasant, friendly Cava. The nose boasts frosted breakfast cereal and lemon curd, while the palate is defined by spiced apple and baked citrus.

71529,71529,Spain,"Fairly bold and ripe up front, with dark berry aromas and an almond candy undercurrent.

71538,71538,Spain,"Classic in every sense, from the early aromas of dill butter to the dry, acid-driven palate to the light, crisp finish.

71562,71562,Spain,"With its black plum, blackberry and other bold, juvenile aromas, this bargain-priced Spaniard shows flavors of chocolate, natural bitterness and good overall balance.

71569,71569,Spain,"No doubt this wine possesses peppery, herbal qualities. But before it's dismissed as green we'd like to note that there's also a nice savory side to it.

82372,82372,Spain,"Smells oily and a little burnt and acrid, with fleshy flavors of banana, melon and bitter pith.

82608,82608,Spain,"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum.

86066,86066,Spain,"Immediately this wine stands out from most Aragón-region Garnachas. It's deep and poised, with smoky blackberry aromas. The palate is deftly woven, saturated and meaty but also creamy and smooth, with mocha and controlled tannins. Freshness is not lost despite its modern, clean power.

86117,86117,Spain,"A well-etched Godello with peach and citrus aromas that are straightforward but clean as glass.

86123,86123,Spain,"Mineral, dark spices, licorice and earthy cherry aromas form a solid, attractive bouquet. The palate is easygoing and chunky, but well built and structured.

86127,86127,Spain,"Clean, fresh and oozing apple and citrus on the nose. The palate mixes some body with spritz to good results, and the flavors of driving lemon, citrus and nectarine work well together.

86161,86161,Spain,"Tight, dark and oaky on the nose, this has woody power, cedary complexity and lots of staunch berry character.

86170,86170,Spain,"The Gil family understands how to make fully loaded reds that are balanced and highly enjoyable.

86228,86228,Spain,"Rooty and slightly green smelling, with rhubarb and cherry skin aromas. Despite a limited bouquet, the palate has weight and creaminess along with sweet berry fruit flavors.

86231,86231,Spain,"Aromas of carpet cleaner and stems constitute a strange mix, while the palate shows good weight and zest along with flavors of candied white fruits and orange peel.

86233,86233,Spain,"We aren't suggesting that this inexpensive Moscato sparkler is great or for everyone, but its soda-like aromas of lychee and lime are not bad and the flavors of honeydew, lime and lychee are decent. Good enough for cake or fruit-based desserts.",Opera Prima Charmat,83,6.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Moscato,J. Garcia Carrion
86235,86235,Spain,"Dark and forceful, with an earthy nose of tar, leather and baked fruit.

86236,86236,Spain,"A bit more rubbery and hard than in the past, with a foamy palate feel and burnt flavors that hint at grilled melon and papaya. Seems sort of lazy and mealy on the finish, and overall it doesn't click past o.k.",Brut Rosé,83,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas

86245,86245,Spain,"Heavy and rasiny, with a mildly cooked essence to the nose. The blend is 80% Prieto Picudo and 20% Mencia, and together it adds up to an unctuous wine with berry, fudge and prune characteristics.

86284,86284,Spain,"The cherry and berry aromas are friendly and ripe. It feels flush, edgy and a little tannic, with a fresh berry flavor that's bundled with a touch of herb.

86302,86302,Spain,"Initially, this may smell a bit hot and leafy, but with time that quality settles. It feels narrow, tannic and condensed, with roasted flavors of red berry, spice and chocolate. The finish offers a mix of citrus, red berry and herb flavors.",Crianza,86,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
86320,86320,Spain,"A nice little wine for easy times. The light citrus aromas lean toward grapefruit, while the fresh, mild palate features apple and tangerine flavors but very little sharpness.

86321,86321,Spain,"Raisiny and sweeet smelling, with baked qualities but also a bitter bite of horseradish.

86325,86325,Spain,"Blackberry and other fruits are presented clearly on the nose, while the rubbery, bouncy palate seems properly tight and balanced.

86348,86348,Spain,"Earthy, rich and black as night, with roasted blackberry aromas that draw you in. Then the palate keeps you there, and even if it runs a bit hard and tannic, the integrity and flavors of coconut, roasted berry and coffee are fine and dandy.

86350,86350,Spain,"A rich, more modern type of Rioja with dark color, slightly raisiny berry aromas and molasses, vanilla and mocha on the nose.

86352,86352,Spain,"Tres Picos, or Three Peaks, ranks as a go-to wine for fans of round, smooth, slightly oaky reds. The bouquet is all mocha and smoky/oaky richness, while the sticky, rich palate deals blackberry and chewy, rooty medicinality. Oaky and spicy late, with licorice and warmth. The best thing is that it's not heavy or overextracted despite being youthful and modern in style.",Tres Picos,90,17.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha,Borsao
86381,86381,Spain,"Cherry and raspberry aromas are a little scratchy, with accents of toast, leather and roasted meat.

86397,86397,Spain,"This five-grape blend is dark and concentrated, but also a touch soupy and mulchy.

86527,86527,Spain,"Red in color, with a reedy, cinnamon nose that speaks to the 60% Pinot Noir in the wine. Flavors of strawberry and raspberry are downgraded by a rhubarb quality, and the mouthfell clamps down like a vise. Fruity but not dry or balanced enough to impress.",Rosé Brut,82,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
86534,86534,Spain,"If it weren't for the core fruit, which is pretty good, this wine would tank. It's so heavy and dark that it doesn't seem like it will last another week.

86535,86535,Spain,"Lollipop aromas are muddled and not very convincing, while the palate is unfocused and borders on sour. Foamy and abrasive on the cheeks, with a mediocre flavor profile.

86549,86549,Spain,"Semi-dry Cavas are a risky row, and this wine proves why.

Bland and bordering on cloying.",Semi Seco Reserva,82,19.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Roger Goulart
86585,86585,Spain,"Jumbled aromas of medicinal fruit, rubber and oak knit together with airing.

86595,86595,Spain,"Dry apple and crisp citrus aromas come with a touch of sweet grass. It has lively lemon-lime and apple flavors, and it seems to have beeen dosed on the sweeter side of extra dry. Overall, it's fruity, friendly and likable.",Extra Dry,86,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
86606,86606,Spain,"This starts with funky, saucy aromas that clean up and become less strange with airing. Rugged, tannic and bumpy on the palate, it has baked, rubbery black-fruit flavors.

86637,86637,Spain,"Gaseous, earthy, mossy aromas are not entirely inviting, and the palate is immensely thick and round, with big, grating tannins.

86639,86639,Spain,"Banana, lemon curd and sawdust are the prime aromas on this oaky, creamy, candied style of Chard from Navarra.

86736,86736,Spain,"A fine wine but not up to par with previous renditions. This vintage has proprietary blueberry, floral and jammy aromas, while the palate is narrow and a touch sheering and tannic, with jammy dark berry flavors and not a lot of variety or complexity.

86753,86753,Spain,"Full and spicy from the get-go, with hints of clove vying with savory berry and leather.

86842,86842,Spain,"Made from the local Rufete grape, this is a prickly, slightly pickled wine.

86847,86847,Spain,"Plum, spice and baked-fruit aromas give you some hope, but the palate on this no-dosage Pinot Noir Cava is tart to the point of being sour.

A textbook warm-climate Spanish wine.",Auroch,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
86931,86931,Spain,"Perfectly drinkable Monastrell year after year despite the silly name. Plum and roasted berry aromas and flavors are sweet, ripe, clean and on the generic side of the fence.

87043,87043,Spain,"Alconte is the new second wine from Montecastro, but it doesn't take a back seat to anything. It's powerful juice, with a strong mineral/floral element on the bouquet.

Angular, aggressive and full of power and lemony oak, it also has raw wood and heavily toasted black-fruit flavors. Long, peppery and choppy, it's powerful and stomping.

87110,87110,Spain,"Expansive and generous on the nose, this has all the bold berry aromas for which Ribera del Duero is known. It feels tight as a drum, with staunch acidity.

It feels soft and basic, with melon and lettuce flavors. Falls off a bit on the finish, which tastes a bit briney.",Ducado de Altan,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Naia
88705,88705,Spain,"This has raisin, earth, mint and dried herb aromas. It feels narrow, but concentrated, tasting of earthy tomato, baked plum and fresh green herb. It has a solid mouthfeel, with a mildly briney finish.",Crianza,84,9.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,Finca Vieja
88708,88708,Spain,"A granular, horsey note is the greeting, and never does this truly find its sweet spot. The aromas are raisiny, while the palate is angular and acidic. Flavors of tomato, herb, tobacco and plum don't quite find their footing. The finish is thick and tastes of molasses, carob and herb.",El Vínculo,84,32.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Alejandro Fernandez
88743,88743,Spain,"Dark on the nose, with licorice notes and mildly roasted black fruit aromas.

For the price and origin, it's right on.",Albaliza,87,9.0,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Tikalo
88759,88759,Spain,"Just makes it to that next level of quality via bright, jumpy, fresh aromas and flavors of raspberry and cherry. It's a simple varietal Grenache that's bright and easy to like if you're into zesty raspberry and berry flavors uplifted by spunky acidity. Best with a little chill on the temperature.",Silver Label,87,12.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
88776,88776,Spain,"Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long. And the palate is similar in that it offers adequate opening flavors of green apple and citrus but no improvement after that. Drink right away; it won't age well.",Blanco,84,9.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Sauvignon Blanc,Basico
88777,88777,Spain,"More soft and milky than exact or pungent, with bitterness intermixed with apple on the palate. Feels a little soft and bland for such a young Rueda white. Perfectly drinkable but uninspired.",,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Analivia
88786,88786,Spain,"Pithy, heavy and chunky, with waxy fruit mixed with oak. The wine has a pretty good mouthfeel and balance, but it just doesn't do much in terms of aromatics or in the flavor category. Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about.",Barrel Fermented White,84,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
88789,88789,Spain,"Raisiny and baked on the nose, with a syrupy consistency to the palate. Along the way there's stewed fruit, baked blackberry pie notes and overt sweetness. Candied, ultrarich and tilting toward molasses on the finish.",Gravedad,83,13.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Casto Pequeño

88835,88835,Spain,"Familiar aromas of black fruit, licorice and earth get it going, followed by saturated body weight that reaches all corners of the mouth while displaying earthy, chunky blackberry and black cherry flavors.

88843,88843,Spain,"From Miguel Angel de Gregorio of Finca Allende, this is a nice, thorough, creamy white with aromas of white fruits, vanilla and straw.

Shows elegance and adequate power, but needs to be drunk soon.",,88,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Finca Nueva
88850,88850,Spain,"Good, pure, dark and teetering on powerful, with strong, rich black plum aromas.

A winner in its price range.",Capitoso,88,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza

88862,88862,Spain,"This is cool on the nose, with tree bark and tobacco aromas that come together well.

88876,88876,Spain,"Among Cavas, this is one of the more yeasty, full-bodied and creamy wines you'll find; it's also cidery, dusty and heavy on the nose. Round, it offers plenty of depth to frame the flavors of candied peach, melon, pear, tarragon and thyme.

88943,88943,Spain,"Here's yet another impressive Garnacha-based wine from the traveling Scotsman Norrel Robertson. There's a black-fruit component that's aided by dried oregano, thyme and briar. The mouth, however, is juicy and ripe, with Syrah-influenced flavors of spice and herbs de Provence. Finishes with licorice, pepper and perfect size. The best wine in Robertson's portfolio.",,91,21.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Red Blend,Papa Luna
89003,89003,Spain,"Good berry aromas come with a hint of spice. It feels peppy and high toned, with a zesty, quick rush of black cherry and plum flavors. It finishes in a flash, leaving little in its wake.",Opera Prima,84,6.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,J. Garcia Carrion
89004,89004,Spain,"Thick and pasty smelling, this has roasted berry scents that are slightly leathery.

The finish is chunky and resiny.",Ribota,84,13.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo,Mano A Mano
89074,89074,Spain,"Years ago Rívola was one of Spain's standout value wines; but over time it has devolved. This version is mulchy and muddled, with heavy roasted fruit and red pepper aromas.

89077,89077,Spain,"Creamy and confected on the nose, which is proof of the “roble” designation. The palate is rather narrow and acidic, with semi-sour flavors of berry and cherry.

89080,89080,Spain,"Smells like bath soap, then turns grassy and burnt. Tannic and medicinal in the mouth, although better as it airs out. Tastes and feels overdone and super sweet.",El Chaparral de Vega Sindoa Old Vines,83,14.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Vega Sindoa
89081,89081,Spain,"Decent mass-produced Ribera del Duero. Strawberry and raspberry aromas lean you in the red fruit direction, and the palate is scouring, acidic and full of cherry fruit.

89082,89082,Spain,"Austere, green aromas are about as much as one can pull from the nose, while the palate is fresh and acidic, but lean.

Turns citric, mustardy and a little like asparagus on the finish.",El Cerezo Unoaked,82,12.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Chardonnay,Castillo de Monjardin
89131,89131,Spain,"A nice, floral, medium-bodied Rioja that should not steer anyone wrong.

89137,89137,Spain,"Broad, bold and buttery, with aromas of toasted white peach, flower blossom, vanilla and mild oxidation.

89210,89210,Spain,"Solid cherry and berry aromas are smooth and appealing, while a spot of pinched leather adds character to the nose.

89219,89219,Spain,"Tobacco and clove aromas ride high on the mildly leafy bouquet. It feels round, juicy, tannic and tight, with mature berry, spice, earth and leather flavors.

89293,89293,Spain,"This is spicy and dry on the nose, with a cheesy accent. It feels medium in body, with sharp acidity that creates a semisour flavor profile of red plum and cherry. Not overly flavorful, it concludes with a crisp, cleansing finish.",,84,12.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Garnacha,Finca Antigua

89308,89308,Spain,"Aromas of canned peaches and apricots are about all one can pull from the bouquet.

89350,89350,Spain,"Smells like a kirsch liqueur on the bouquet. The palate, somewhat surprisingly, is much sharper than the nose, with tangy, zesty flavors of red fruits that some might adore and others will label too thin and sour. Sheer but fresh on the finish, with pulsing acidity. Personally, I find this rather sharp and wanting, given the origin.",Torre de Golbán Reserva,86,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto Fino,Atalayas de Golbán
89355,89355,Spain,"Delicate and lithe Sauvignon Blanc from Navarra? Interesting. Tastes sort of Galician due to its clean, tropical pineapple, citrus and green apple flavors. Like a fruit salad with more acidity; doesn't taste particularly Sauvignon-ish, but likable nonetheless.",Orchidea,86,13.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Sauvignon Blanc,Inurrieta
89372,89372,Spain,"Rusty colored and flat on the nose. Aromas of medicinal fruit and horse hide are less than stellar, and the soupy palate of weak raspberry and faux sweetness doesn't do much to improve things. Needs more vitality and overall quality.",,82,10.0,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Altozano
89376,89376,Spain,"Starts with nutty, oily, acrid aromas, and never is there much fruit character.

89387,89387,Spain,"Generic fruit, hard rubber, olive and leather on the nose. Dry and tannic, with bitter black plum and a rock-hard finish. Tough and just not that much fun to drink.",Finca la Sabina,82,14.0,Central Spain,Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo Blend,Sanchez Muliterno
89393,89393,Spain,"One of the strangest-smelling wines we've encountered from Spain: there's forced cinnamon, heavy funk, dampness and other unfamiliar, foreign scents.

89433,89433,Spain,"A bit earthy and leafy on the nose and palate, with lightweight strawberry and raspberry aromas and flavors.

89455,89455,Spain,"Pink meets orange in terms of hue, while the nose gives a nice blend of sweet and snappy berry and citrus.

89457,89457,Spain,"Sort of scratchy and generic on the nose, with reasonably fresh red fruit aromas.

89485,89485,Spain,"The green fruit and subtle, yeasty hay aromas are inviting. It feels nice and not abrasive, with notes of dried apple, citrus and rich, toasty yeast.

89528,89528,Spain,"Pure apple and peach aromas are the calling card of a good Albariño, and Pazo de Senorans always has that and a little more. The '08 seems a touch less concentrated and leesy than prior years, but it's still showing all the marine-influenced personality, beauty and elegance of a no-oak, seafood-friendly winner.

89580,89580,Spain,"Rubber, flower petal and candied fruit aromas comprise the unique bouquet.

89594,89594,Spain,"This has a reedy red-berry aroma and a citrus note. Confirmation of the bouquet comes on the palate, which is lean and scouring, with red plum, pomegranate and herb flavors.

89608,89608,Spain,"Gaseous and minerally on first blush, it has funky, earthy aromas of leaves and olive that could use a hit of freshness.

89690,89690,Spain,"Peach and melon aromas are inviting and clean. Very juicy and juice-like in the mouth, probably more so than I can remember for this wine.

89877,89877,Spain,"Slightly volatile and jammy, but still good for the price range. The nose is pungent and mildly prickly, but it settles in the long run. Like most RDDs, it's intense and jammy in the mouth, with concentration and flavors of raspberry, tomato, salad dressing and even chocolate. If all this sounds a bit scattered and all over the map, it is.

89935,89935,Spain,"The first act of dried spices and light, dusty red fruit aromas is honest and subdued.

Potent for the variety.",,87,22.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Don Olegario
90012,90012,Spain,"A little gritty and tough on the nose, with hard strawberry and kirsch aromas. The palate is voluminous and foamy, with flavors of burnt blood orange and grilled pink grapefruit.

90218,90218,Spain,"Broad, dark and meaty, with aromas of leather and beef broth.

A blend of 65% Garnacha and 35% Tempranillo.",La Vendimia,88,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Palacios Remondo
90660,90660,Spain,"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak. More tannic and woody than one might hope for, with lactic notes on the finish. Shows flashes but comes up average. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",Flor del Montgó Old Vines,85,,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Montgó
90661,90661,Spain,"Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral. The palate is just as bright and bouncy, with red fruit running away with things. A touch of mineral and chocolate at the end gives it some darkness to match the vibrancy.",,85,8.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Wrongo Dongo
90663,90663,Spain,"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be. The palate, however, is quite sweet and supports the Semi Dry labeling. Candied but not sticky, with a slightly chalky finish.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,85,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
90671,90671,Spain,"Ultra purple and sort of gummy and confected. But it's also pretty solid in the mouth, with tannin instead of flatness holding things together.

90672,90672,Spain,"The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented.

90676,90676,Spain,"Already in the twilight of its lifespan, this is a friendly rosé with a little wiggle and kick.

A little pithy but pretty good if you get at it soon.",,85,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Rosé,Tapeña
90710,90710,Spain,"Big and dark, and it comes with no shortage of prune, blackberry, smoky oak and depth.

90740,90740,Spain,"This is incredibly inviting on the bouquet due to aromas of leather, raisin, tea and mocha.

90753,90753,Spain,"More red than dark, with semisweet aromas of candy, strawberry and a bit of grassy green. The palate is easygoing and creamy, with milk chocolate and berry flavors along with overt wood-driven spice. Finishes with drying tannins, another wave of oak and just enough snap to keep it moving in the right direction. Good but not great by Priorat standards.",,86,23.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Los 800
90758,90758,Spain,"Nobody should mistake this idiosyncratic Basque white wine for a bargain. At $25, you had better like steely, almost sour-style whites to justify going here. But if you can find the pleasure in Txakoli, then this one is good. It has peach and nectarine aromas, which are backed by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors. Naturally sharp and cleansing on the finish, and thus good for seafood tapas and the like.",,86,25.0,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,,White Blend,Txomín Etxaníz
90760,90760,Spain,"Young, jumpy and slightly candied, but that's just fine given the price range it's playing in. To get old-vines Garnacha for a song is not uncommon, yet this wine's thick, fruity palate goes beyond the norm. And with a round mouthfeel built on light-framed tannins, it's easygoing as can be. Drink now, but don't put it under the microscope.",Menguante,86,10.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo

90768,90768,Spain,"A little bit strange and unusual on the nose, with roasted meat, young oak, popcorn and only modest fruit aromas.

90771,90771,Spain,"Dark and crusty on the nose, with cola, raisin and foresty dampness. The palate has wintergreen along with solid black cherry flavors, while accents of pepper and licorice give it a dark side. Finishes a bit grating and tannic, with espresso-like bitterness.

90845,90845,Spain,"Aromas of pure cherry are pointed but clean. That more or less describes the wine, which hits with sharp acidity but also good, slightly roasted flavors of cherry and plum.

90849,90849,Spain,"Stony apple aromas are mostly neutral and lead to a fleshy, semisoft palate with citrus, kiwi and notes of oxidation. Nice and easy but sort of plump and bland.

90900,90900,Spain,"Grapey and potent as Rioja crianzas go, with a medium-to-full-sized palate that's full of bright acidity and standard but solid berry fruit flavors.

90906,90906,Spain,"Very light in body, color and aromas. The nose is punchy and a bit sharp, and so is the palate, which offers crisp, bracing acids to highlight zesty, lean nectarine and tangerine flavors. Quite linear and citric, but experience with this wine says it shows best with food.",,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Rosé,Muga
90908,90908,Spain,"Soda pop-like on the nose, with a clear reference to Sprite and 7Up. The palate is somewhat candied and simple, but it has good feel and the flavors of lemon-lime are likable. Mild on the finish, with flavors that extend from the lemon-lime bouquet and palate.",Brut,86,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Mistinguett
90913,90913,Spain,"A chunky wine with compost, coffee and leather on the nose. The palate holds onto that chunkiness with clumsy flatness that goes with herbal plum and berry flavors. Airing allows it to unfold and find a better place, but always does it seem heavy and on the murky side.",Lealtanza Selección Especial Reserva,86,36.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza
90915,90915,Spain,"The opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good.

Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.",Viña Alarba Old Vines,86,10.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Grenache,Bodegas y Vinedos del Jalón
90919,90919,Spain,"Starts out muddled and murky, and eventually settles on rich, raisiny and slightly stewed.

90922,90922,Spain,"Piercing to start, with leathery, bacony and campfire aromas. Saturated, although healthy, if a bit hard and tannic.

90929,90929,Spain,"Opens with bright, popping cherry aromas that are straightforward, much like the rest of the show.

Nice but basic Rioja.",Viña Zaco,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Bilbainas
90937,90937,Spain,"This is dense yet fresh, with dark berry and mild earth aromas.

90963,90963,Spain,"A bit of forward oak comes across on the nose, while mocha and pretty good berry fruit keep things focused.

Classic finishing notes of olive and dill close things out.",Selección Reserva,85,23.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Alconde
90968,90968,Spain,"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else.

A nice and simple food wine.",Crianza,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Señorío de Sarria
90978,90978,Spain,"A little creamy, waxy and scattershot, but also far more exotic and different than most $8 wines. This is barrel-fermented Viura, but the oak level is light and manageable.

Drink right away for maximum freshness.",Conde de Valdemar,85,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Bodegas Valdemar
90994,90994,Spain,"Fresh, pure and minerally, with lime and peach aromas. This is a fine Viura that is lively, balanced and flavorful.

Imported by Pasternak Wine Imports.",Cune Monopole,89,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,CVNE
91016,91016,Spain,"Full and clean, with a bright nose of cherry, plum and pepper. This is full-bodied, with extract and tannic bite.

Modern and ready to drink.",Manga del Brujo,89,21.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Red Blend,El Escocés Volante
91017,91017,Spain,"Good value for a bear of a wine. It's 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet, and it certainly has teeth.

Not a shy wine.",,89,15.0,Levante,Valencia,,Tempranillo Blend,El Molinet
91018,91018,Spain,"A big set of roasted aromas includes hints of smoke, mineral, bacon and black fruit.

Good structure; well-made wine.",Reserva,89,36.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinta Fina,Legaris
91019,91019,Spain,"Even in a marginal vintage, you should expect a true and polished taste of Toro from Maurodos's Prima label.

Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Prima,89,24.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
91049,91049,Spain,"Modern and bulky, this has a lot of great things going on. It opens with aromas of mineral, graphite, sage and bold berry, with chewy, roasted black-fruit flavors.

91055,91055,Spain,"Hard to say who this wine is made for; must be the old schooler who likes lightness and elegance.

Fades with vanilla and tobacco notes. Drink right away.",Chateldon Gran Reserva,85,36.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pinord
91058,91058,Spain,"A wine with faults and a few positives. On the nose, it's roasted almost to the point of being overdone. It smells like baked fruit, roasted peanuts and tire tread. Doesn't sound great, does it? But in the mouth its more true and recognizable; flavors of tomato leaf, dried red fruit, vanilla and dill are known entities, while the finish is long and draped with even more dill weed. Drink now. This is not one to save.",Selección Reserva,85,21.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Ramirez de la Piscina
91063,91063,Spain,"With lime, citrus and other linear aromas, this is nothing if not fresh. The palate is scouring and spritzy, and swishing it across the tongue will create a sudsy mouthfeel.

91070,91070,Spain,"Lots of color but quiet and shy, with only minimal expressiveness throughout. The palate offers just one level of baked-fruit flavors, but no variance or complexity.

91073,91073,Spain,"A little gaseous and funky on the nose, but that's common for inexpensive Garnacha. Once it unfolds, it deals saturated, chunky black-fruit flavors, a jammy mouthfeel and fatness on the finish. It isn't all that structured, but it doesn't lack for size. Maybe a touch green at its core, but given the price that's not a major fault.",Malena,85,10.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Garnacha,Torres
91147,91147,Spain,"Kind of a downer given past performances of this label and the high quality of the '05 harvest.

91168,91168,Spain,"Powerful but not real precise, especially as the earthy, tight nose unveils itself.

91210,91210,Spain,"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas.

91257,91257,Spain,"Smells more meaty and leathery than you might expect for a basic, young Tempranillo.

This is all about sweet, youthful fruit, so if you're looking for sophistication at bargain- basement prices you're shopping in the wrong place.

95215,95215,Spain,"Notes of baked-berry, herb and savory spice come together well on the bouquet. It feels chunky and round but lively, with plum and cassis flavors that carry an herbal, tomatoey shading. This is fresh and herbal enough so that you know it's Old World.",Gran Coronas Reserva,88,24.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
95226,95226,Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors. Settles nicely on the finish, and overall this wine shows almost all of what's good about modern Ribera del Duero wines. 250 cases made; drink now through 2015.",Tinto Figuero Noble,93,131.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
95243,95243,Spain,"Outstanding Sherry with complexity, richness and character. The nose has a salinic zest to it, making it no wallflower, and of course there's raisin and prune. The palate is formed, sculpted and balanced, with peanut M&M;'s candy, roasted fruit, chocolate ice cream and more. A beauty with power and poise.",Matusalem Oloroso Dulce Viejo,93,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
95247,95247,Spain,"This is the tier-two wine from the Egurens' new Toro project, and it's stellar. Intense aromas of black fruit, char and mint start it out, and next up come cola, roasted black fruit, clove and cured-meat flavors. Oak is forward now, but it should settle in a year or so. A dynamite Toro to drink from 2011 through 2018.",Victorino,93,71.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Teso La Monja
95249,95249,Spain,"A wonderfully balanced and giving wine with sweet raisin and prune aromas and an overall richness akin to crude oil. Flavors of baked black plum, brown sugar and molasses are both juicy and rich, and then toffee and mocha take over on the finish. Sweet and thick for sure, but with discernible fruit and vitality.",Noe Viejo,93,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,González Byass
95250,95250,Spain,"Fairly gassy and sulfuric off the bat, so the nose isn't ideal. Patience will be partially rewarded with jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors along with mocha. However, it never does fully get rolling. It settles on solid but midlevel red-fruit flavors and a similar mouthfeel.",,85,18.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Gazur
95254,95254,Spain,"An ordinary but competent Rioja. The fruit is light but young and fresh; the palate touches on raspberry and plum.

95257,95257,Spain,"Slightly reduced but still balanced enough to give off a positive early impression. The wine is sweet, almost syrupy, but it's that same ripeness that gives it more oomph and richness than most under-$10 wines. Finishes baked and almost stewy, but if you get at it early it should deliver all the black fruit and size one can expect from a value-priced offering.",Reinares,85,8.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Eguren
95262,95262,Spain,"Slightly prickly and peppery on the nose, but there's enough clean red-fruit aromas and dustiness to bring it along. The palate is simple and nice enough, with tight acidity, stanching dryness and zest. A good but limited wine that delivers what it should but nothing beyond that.",,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Darien
95263,95263,Spain,"Dry melon and papaya aromas are common and proper for Cava. The palate, however, is ultrasweet and is weighted down by the wine's dosage.

95267,95267,Spain,"Mildy green and drying on the nose, with bramble and leather along with distant red fruit. The palate is soft, light and fluid, with mild raspberry and plum flavors.

95270,95270,Spain,"A little sluggish on the nose, but if you concentrate on the feel and overall balance the wine grades out fairly well. The flavors run from pickled raspberry to salty plum, and never is the wine very sweet or rich. Conversely, it settles on tight and lean, with juiciness rather than pulp.",Añada,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Lar de Paula
95271,95271,Spain,"Simple floral and sweet-fruit aromas are good, while the palate runs creamy and thick, with dull-edged plum, berry and chocolate flavors.

95274,95274,Spain,"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings. It's a like a ride down a pocked and bumpy gravel road.",Monte Castrillo,84,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
95277,95277,Spain,"Warm and earthy at first, but more soupy as it opens. Crisp, snappy red-fruit flavors are also on the herbal side. Nervy yet it does show a reasonable amount of honest Rioja quality. Still, for a 2001 reserva it doesn't amount to much.",Reserva,84,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Castillo Clavijo
95278,95278,Spain,"Young and bouncy, and that's to be expected from this type of juvenile Tempranillo. However, should you like full-fruit young wines with force and no oak, it's not at all bad. Expect juicy black cherry and other runaway flavors.",,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
95279,95279,Spain,"Simultaneously snappy and creamy on the nose.

95368,95368,Spain,"Rock solid and dense, with aromas of black cherry and cassis along with a whiff of aged cheese.

95466,95466,Spain,"This wine explores the fresher, racier side of the Priorat region. Berry fruit with just the slightest hint of raisin dominates the nose and the palate.

Imported by Grapes of Spain.",,86,22.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Los 800
95469,95469,Spain,"Tropical and easy to like. We don't see many white Garnachas in the U.S., but this one shows mango, melon and vanilla on the nose and the palate follows up with lychee, apple and baking spice flavors.

Best Buy.",Garnacha Blanca,86,11.0,Catalonia,Terra Alta,,Grenache Blanc,Las Colinas Del Ebro
95474,95474,Spain,"Gritty, granular and a bit raisiny at first, and then more settled later on. For Monastrell this is snappy, dry and solid, with cherry, raspberry, plum and vanilla forming a standard flavor package.

95494,95494,Spain,"This is slightly smoky, toasty and yeasty up front, with a touch of matchstick to the nose.

95505,95505,Spain,"This leans a little green and soda-like on the nose, but it picks up clarity and speed on the palate, which carries a tangy, citric snap.

95509,95509,Spain,"Roasted plum, baked berry and jammy aromas can't be missed, but it's structured and not at all soft in the mouth, with wild berry, cherry and boysenberry flavors. It really pours on the fruit, ending fresh with no nonsense.",,88,15.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,Mas Sorrer
95510,95510,Spain,"Dry, toasty and composed up front, this has a nice palate set straight by proper acidity and base structure.

95522,95522,Spain,"Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth.

95561,95561,Spain,"Burnt oak, tire rubber and bramble vie with blackberry and vanilla aromas.

95564,95564,Spain,"A bit aggressive, with handsoap and citrus aromas. The palate is lean and clean, with lemon juice, grapefruit and lime flavors. Any way you look at it, this is an apéritif wine.

95566,95566,Spain,"Red in color and pretty clean on the nose, where raspberry and rose petal essence come together.

95572,95572,Spain,"We didn't go crazy over the 2005 and the '06 Sentido is also challenged. It's soft, raisiny and borderline overripe. The flavors are roasted and short, with low acidity, soft tannins and plenty of toast and coffee on the black finish. More baked than vivacious, with some excess weight.",Sentido,84,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Neo
95577,95577,Spain,"Our bet is that a granular, reduced, raisiny wine like this will not have broad appeal.

95781,95781,Spain,"Lightly fragrant and fruity on the nose, with earth and leather to give it meaning.

95791,95791,Spain,"The aromas of orange and mineral are uncomplicated and friendly. It feels pure and offers good flow, with apple, lime, mineral, white pepper and anise flavors.

95854,95854,Spain,"A bit cheesy and funky, with rhubarb and leather along with baked berry aromas.

95866,95866,Spain,"Solid but unspectacular on the nose, with plum scents and generic sweetness.

95878,95878,Spain,"Cloudy in appearance but fairly clear on the nose and palate.

95879,95879,Spain,"Lean, dry raspberry aromas and a slight floral essence carry the nose toward a zesty, semisharp palate with crisp cherry and cranberry flavors.

Light fruit and simple oak is all that's here.",A4 Nuestro Equilibrio,83,23.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Anta
96256,96256,Spain,"A little scratchy on the nose, but otherwise it exudes pure aromas of cassis and raspberry. The palate is juicy, racy and snappy but full and structured, while the flavors of raspberry, plum and blackberry get sweetness in the form of coconut and vanilla-infused coffee. Less soft and bodied than previous vintages but a big winner nonetheless.",Colección Privada,91,54.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
96331,96331,Spain,"The nose is floral and earthy, with light berry aromas. It feels a bit clacky, with lemon-driven acidity in front of oaky, savory, earthy berry flavors. This is taut and a little warm on the finish, with savory, salty flavors and a clipped feel.",Vendimia Seleccionada,85,30.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Resalte
96334,96334,Spain,"This smells mildly grassy and green at first, while balsamic vinegar and tobacco notes enter the frame later on. It's solid and average in mouthfeel, with a slightly sweet and syrupy berry flavor that's tempered by tomato-driven acidity.",Crianza,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Casa de la Reina
96339,96339,Spain,"This smells foxy and jumpy, with a candied cherry aroma. Fresh and forward, scratchy and rough, this has raspberry, plum and resiny oak flavors. It breaks down and turns somewhat metallic on the finish.",Third Generation Dama de Toro,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
96340,96340,Spain,"Green melon and lettuce aromas are fresh and clean. The wine feels solid and good, and there's a jumble of baked apple and melon flavors. Yeasty on the finish, it's made entirely from Macabeo grapes.",Brut,85,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Idilicum
96342,96342,Spain,"Initally it smells rubbery and nutty, with a baked, earthy personality. With airing, it opens somewhat but remains leathery and cheesy. This feels fairly full, with baked, toasty flavors of herb, berry and plum. It is moderately long on the finish.",Reserva,85,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Valdubón
96343,96343,Spain,"Jammy berry, blueberry and spice aromas meet the nose, followed by a narrow palate that turns softer as the wine airs out. Flavors of jammy berry and raisin end on a mellow, chewy finish. A soft Garnacha for casual consumption.",Viñas Viejas,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Viña Alarba
96345,96345,Spain,"Moderately leafy and brambly smelling, this is supported by its berry aroma. It feels edgy and juicy, with tangy, herbal raspberry and plum flavors. The finish is quick and snappy, with a hint of tomato and lasting green flavor.",Sangre de Toro,85,12.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Red Blend,Torres
96357,96357,Spain,"Floral berry aromas are fresh and carry only the slightest grassy, green element. The wine feels crisp and tight, with nice red plum and raspberry flavors. Mild, focused and not very hefty or thick on the finish.",,85,9.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
96368,96368,Spain,"Clean as polished glass, with touches of red plum and cherry on the nose. The palate is fresh and balanced, but basic and moderate in terms of flavors.

96372,96372,Spain,"If basic Argentinean Torrontés is to your liking, so will this be. It's fresh and green on the nose, with melon and lychee aromas. Those fruits carry onto the palate, where lemon-lime and crystallized mango flavors are sweet but crisped up by snappy acidity. Serve chilled. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",Viura & Chardonnay,85,11.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,White Blend,Ochoa
96381,96381,Spain,"Big and baked, with aromas of cheese and leather offsetting sweet black fruit. Flavors of cola, blackberry and chocolate are as baked and sweet as the nose, and the feel is grabby and leaves a sugary residue on the finish.

96383,96383,Spain,"Aromas of barrel spice and grilled pineapple are solid, while the palate is thick and creamy with orange marmalade and banana flavors.

Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",Vinya Gigi,84,24.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Chardonnay,Jean León
96386,96386,Spain,"Spice and leather aromas are positive while the smells of burnt leaves and green herbs aren't too appealing.

And the finish evaporates fast, leaving heat and medicinal notes.",Proyecto Cu4ro,84,12.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Red Blend,Bodegas Concavins
96387,96387,Spain,"Minty smelling, with herbal red fruit and rhubarb scents. The wine is clack, clack, clack on the palate as acids and snappy red fruit draw everything down to the base level. Flavors of raspberry and light vanilla are clean but high-toned, and there's an undercurrent of tomato. A tough wine from a vintage to forget.",Reserva,84,25.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Casa de la Ermita
96389,96389,Spain,"A touch green and grassy at the start, with cinnamon, cherry candy and red-fruit aromas.

Finishes light and quick, making it an easygoing red wine that isn't meant for deep analysis.",,84,9.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Lelia
96391,96391,Spain,"This is a unique wine from Mallorca with light cherry and raspberry aromas. Clampy, dry and tannic on the palate, it's full of savory, roasted barbecue flavors along with tomato and red fruit notes.

96422,96422,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose.

96431,96431,Spain,"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak.

Drink now through 2015.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,91,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
96438,96438,Spain,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,59.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
96439,96439,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful. Sweet but balanced by mild coffee-like bitterness on the finish.",Solera 1847 Oloroso Dulce,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
96446,96446,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great. Drink now through 2016. Only 250 cases made.",El Belisario,91,80.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Agrícola Labastida
96452,96452,Spain,"Almost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.",Javier Asensio Tinto,83,10.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Asensio
96457,96457,Spain,"Very dark and seemingly on the cooked side of the ledger. The nose is black and raisiny, while the core flavors are saucy. At least this meaty, overdone Garnacha isn't oaked, so in that sense it isn't offensive. But it is definitely soft, and without much future.",Viñas Viejas,83,11.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
96459,96459,Spain,"Airén is a big-crop white grape that is usually distilled into brandy or made into Sherry.

96462,96462,Spain,"Apple and powdery citrus aromas are austere but intriguing. But in the mouth, this thing foams like bubble bath. No matter whether you like the wine's citric flavors and apple essence or not, the fact that it bubbles up like a shaken soda is not an attribute. Oriel's gran reserva is similar in terms of carbonation issues.",Brut,82,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Oriol Rossell
96468,96468,Spain,"Brambly and tart, with a peppery, leathery nose. It's zesty, lightly concentrated Garnacha with zingy, mouth-burning raspberry and plum flavors. A sharp, reticent wine in every way. Imported by USA Wine Imports.",Ladera,82,21.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Algairen
96469,96469,Spain,"A lesson in contrasts: the nose is both weedy and sweet, with green strawberry aromas mixing with caramel. The palate is also green and slightly bitter, but that's offset by some jammy berry sweetness. Medium in terms of weight, but with burdensome sugars and a clumsy finish.",Vertus Crianza,82,15.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Iranzo
96472,96472,Spain,"An herbal and brambly roughneck with forced aromas, lots of leather, and ultimately cranberry and other tart red-fruit flavors. Not much body, and thus it's short and piquant.",Roble,82,21.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Hemar
96562,96562,Spain,"An elegant and well-made Albariño with lemon chiffon, pear and green apple aromas.

Drink this pretty wine as soon as possible.",,90,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Leira
96631,96631,Spain,"This smells like plastic and milk chocolate at first, then with airing it begins to take on its classically Rioja character.

A mid-level wine in every way.",Reserva,85,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Casa de la Reina
96632,96632,Spain,"Medicinal cherry and plum scents come with a grassy, minty persistence.

It finishes chunky, with a minty aftertaste.",Dehesa Gago,85,18.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Telmo Rodríguez
96651,96651,Spain,"This is flat and lemony on the nose, with a hint of asparagus. It feels zesty and tastes of tart lemon-lime and green bean. Tangy but not edgy or razor-like on the finish. This is a classic cool-climate white with citrus and green elements running the show.",,84,26.0,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,,White Blend,Zudugarai
96655,96655,Spain,"Dry on the nose, this has light red-fruit aromas that are offset by spice and vanilla notes. It feels snappy and raw, with tart citrus, plum and tomato flavors.

96656,96656,Spain,"This smells rubbery and a bit gamy, with meaty berry aromas. Tannic, with gaps in the mouthfeel, it has flavors of prune and herb, which are not excessively sweet or raisiny. The finish is dry, tannic and steady.",Roble,84,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Prado Rey
96659,96659,Spain,"A standard raspberry aroma introduces this wine, which feels short on substance but reasonable, with jammy, medicinal flavors of raspberry and strawberry. It is sweet, mild and candied on the finish.",Joven,84,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Viña Palaciega
96662,96662,Spain,"A tiny bit earthy and peppery, with solid berry fruit aromas. The palate is sappy and medium-weight, with red-fruit flavors dominated by raspberry.

96663,96663,Spain,"Definitely sweet, syrupy and raisiny.

96676,96676,Spain,"A decent old-school throwback, with dried spice, pepper and slight red-fruit aromas followed by a light-bodied palate of plum and raspberry.

96683,96683,Spain,"A fleshy, simple wine with gumball aromas. The palate is chubby but not all that structured, with plump but basic berry and plum flavors.

96684,96684,Spain,"Starts out pretty good and fruity, but becomes more challenged with time. There's a truckload of early raspberry fruit, but it turns more sharp and piercing the more time it sits. Lengthy and potent, but not elevated.",,84,12.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca Antigua
96685,96685,Spain,"Sweet and syrupy, with molasses on the nose. On one hand it's rich, ripe and flavorful, but also cooked, lumpy and heavy.

96692,96692,Spain,"This is as crisp and dry as a whispy reed, with a mild grassy note on the nose. It feels fresh and focused, with lime, peach and apple flavors.

96704,96704,Spain,"This is a little wayward and funky on the nose, with a lightly pickled aroma. It's a forward Cava with a yeasty, creamy feel.

96710,96710,Spain,"Aromas of root beer, autumn leaves, leather and raisins indicate ripeness more than heavyness.

96712,96712,Spain,"Lemon, lime, apple and nectarine aromas are regular and clean. It feels good, citrusy and just round enough, with passion fruit, grapefruit and orange flavors. Tasty and fresh, this works well as a refresher.",,87,13.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Bodegas Solo Privee
96721,96721,Spain,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors.

96737,96737,Spain,"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate.

96746,96746,Spain,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast.

96751,96751,Spain,"Ribera is not prime rosé country, and this wine doesn't much help the cause.

96766,96766,Spain,"There's something not right about the way this winery is fermenting its Cavas because both this and Oriol Rossell's regular brut are excessively foamy.

98491,98491,Spain,"Reasonably fresh on the nose, but ultranarrow and tart in the mouth. In fact, it's borderline sour in the way it presents such linear red fruit. Tight as a drum and sheering.

The finish tastes stalky, like hay or straw. Only 250 cases made.",,84,22.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Godello,Luna Beberide
102365,102365,Spain,"If at first the wine seems sweet and scattered, just give it time. Soon the nose will knit together to show mocha and that lightly oxidized elegance that is Oloroso.

102382,102382,Spain,"Fino Sherry rarely has this kind of weight and complexity.

102384,102384,Spain,"On the cusp of unbridled excellence, but since it's Cims' second wine it has its limitations.

102454,102454,Spain,"Heavier and oakier than No. 12, and in our opinion not quite as balanced.

102560,102560,Spain,"Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine.

102574,102574,Spain,"A warm, aggressive wine with baked berry aromas, kirsch, bacon and rubber.

102641,102641,Spain,"Really good and interesting Syrah, with chocolate, campfire, menthol and prune on the nose. With airing the wine quickly settles into a deep, smooth berry and chocolate groove, while the finish deals pure tannins and comfort.

102709,102709,Spain,"With dusty apple cider aromas and tingling acidity, this seems a lot like Galician Albariño even though it's from Costers del Segre in Catalonia.

103432,103432,Spain,"This is far and away the best Mirto of all time. It's ripe and brawny, with bacon and black-fruit aromas that put it squarely into the Nuevo Classic mold. In the mouth, licorice and nutmeg flavors give character to smooth blackberry and dark plum flavors, while the finish is cushioned, herbal and long. Immediately appealing but with five to ten years of aging potential.",Mirto,92,65.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao

104314,104314,Spain,"Méntrida is an island wine region in the middle of central Spain, and this blend of Garnacha and Syrah is lively, juicy and delicious.

105227,105227,Spain,"Past vintages of Imperial Gran Reserva have seemed sharp and dilute; not the 1998, which is resolute in its delivery of cumin, root beer and subtle raspberry aromas.

109037,109037,Spain,"Dusty and neutral on the nose, with a hint of wild flower and mineral to stir interest. The palate is dry despite having some size and plumpness; flavors of apple, peach and papaya are crisp and lean.",Estate Bottled Dry,85,13.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Muscat,Sumarroca
109040,109040,Spain,"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior. Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.",Blanco Fermentado en Barrica,85,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
109046,109046,Spain,"Oily and pungent, as if the cat were not let out of the house. But airing reveals a wide spectrum of green, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables.

109056,109056,Spain,"Cáceres does basic Viura as well as anyone in Spain. Every year this wine shows a confident blend of citrus and mineral, with aromas of citrus fruits and pineapple and flavors of green apple and lime. It's juicy, fresh and amounts to the quintessential summer sipper.",,87,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
109060,109060,Spain,"For inexpensive Albariño, Nessa delivers the goods. The nose is flowery and soft, but most of all it's inviting.

Drink right away.",,87,12.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Nessa
109072,109072,Spain,"Cotton candy and warm, dusty aromas give the wine pleasant, semisweet opening aromas.

A good wine with just a touch of sweetness in the middle; must be a touch of residual sugar here.",,87,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Rosé,Marqués de Cáceres
109301,109301,Spain,"Over a year ago this wine rated only 86, but bottle age has improved it, and now its condensed nose of black fruit and chocolate mint chip is very pleasing.

Proof that wines do change over time, and that sometimes we underrate the youngsters.",,91,57.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Pago de Larrainzar
109309,109309,Spain,"A forward wine with earthy aromas, leather and a hint of Navarra's herbal essence. The palate is full-bodied and complete, with balanced weight and tannic structure.

109321,109321,Spain,"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out.

109332,109332,Spain,"Approach this simple Tempranillo with modest expectations and the jammy cherry aromas and flavors will strike you as pure and fresh.

109349,109349,Spain,"Clean, wet, a bit sweet and rather formulaic, this Verdejo has a soft, chummy personality and seemingly more than a dash of residual sugar.

109350,109350,Spain,"This wine is clearly shooting for the modern style of Rioja; it's dark as night, soft and meaty. But it also has a lot of gaseous sulfur on the nose and hard tannins.

109357,109357,Spain,"A little rough around the edges, i.e. there's a sharp note to the nose and then lots of barrel char to back that up.

109378,109378,Spain,"Coconut and wintergreen aromas announce new oak, and as it opens this somewhat muscular Rioja unveils butter and charred scents.

Drink now through 2009.",Inspiración Valdemar,87,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Valdemar
109507,109507,Spain,"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration.

109614,109614,Spain,"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right.

109627,109627,Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character.

109628,109628,Spain,"Matchstick, mushroom and licorice nib aromas add character to this fading but textured wine that struggles to offer peach and nectarine flavors.

109634,109634,Spain,"Dry black cherry and berry fruit shows some early chemical accents, and the wine stays sort of thin and hard all the way to the end.

109805,109805,Spain,"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits.

109818,109818,Spain,"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors.

109867,109867,Spain,"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack.

109923,109923,Spain,"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range.

109934,109934,Spain,"Aromatic notes of talcum powder and scented candles give this Bordeaux blend from Navarra a light, pleasant bouquet.

110341,110341,Spain,"Spice, herbs, smoked meat and a dark core work in harmony on the bouquet.

110554,110554,Spain,"Not an expressive Rueda but it sizzles. Despite being young and driving, it's more neutral in flavor and texture than the winery's Verdejo, which is excellent.

It's a Monastrell-dominated blend, but it tastes a lot like Tempranillo, which is only 15% of the blend. Very nice overall.",Selección Roble,89,13.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Alceño
110933,110933,Spain,"A classic cava from top to bottom. The nose offers familiar baked apple, mineral and saline aromas, while the palate is exceedingly fresh in its delivery of pineapple, apple and nectarine flavors. A fruity yet crisp number that foams up nicely on the palate but doesn't lose its focus or form.",Aria Estate Brut,89,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
110935,110935,Spain,"Black fruit, licorice and earth are all aromas of classic Montsant, and together they are easy to enjoy and understand. Ripe black cherry, pepper and an undercurrent of licorice and coffee work the palate, while the finish sports tight acids and smooth tannins. Good now through 2009.",,89,35.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,Mas Franch
110937,110937,Spain,"A touch heavy, but not nearly as weighty and syrupy as this winery's '03 Excelencia. At 14%, it's a bit raisiny and blustery, but the dark plum and coffee flavors do manage to please. And the finish is full of chocolate and fudge-like residue. Big but fun; ready to be drunk now.",El Albar,88,20.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
110938,110938,Spain,"Keeps the Cordon Negro reputation healthy by delivering easygoing lemon-lime aromas and round citrus and apple flavors.

111000,111000,Spain,"Somontano is not exactly prime real estate among Spanish wine regions, but Blecua, a four-grape blend led by Cabernet Sauvignon, is one of the best wines the region has to offer. Smoke, licorice, rooty cola and lemony oak aromas mix with flavors of blackberry, coffee, cola and roasted meats. It's a bit choppy and hard now, but time will help it along. A classy wine to drink from 2011 through 2016.",Blecua,91,100.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero
111006,111006,Spain,"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity.

111049,111049,Spain,"A big, ripe and earthy wine, with some baked black fruit and chocolate to the nose.

The finish has an herbal tinge.",Élite,89,48.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Conde de Siruela
111050,111050,Spain,"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco. It's crisp and zesty, which is probably reflective of the cool 2002 vintage, but still it's a very nice wine with depth and dexterity. Drink now.",Vendimia Seleccionada,89,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Luis Alegre
111063,111063,Spain,"Raw and resiny, with no peg for you to hang your hat on. The palate is sharp and short on ripeness, while the finish settles on hot. Just an aggressive wine with little polish. Not worth the price.",Javier Asensio,82,29.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Merlot,Asensio
111077,111077,Spain,"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine.

111085,111085,Spain,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",,80,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Eleusis
111118,111118,Spain,"A forward specimen with lots of oak that settles on cinnamon and wood tannin. Also a touch leafy on the nose, and that's backed by tangy cranberry and acid-driven cherry flavors. Very tight and piercing, which for a 2005 crianza is asking too much.",Crianza,85,30.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Hemar
111119,111119,Spain,"A crisp, clean, no-frills white wine that pushes citrus more than heft.

111151,111151,Spain,"Slightly sweet on the nose, the aromas of baked fruit, cream soda and vanilla are welcoming. Interestingly, the wine is a bit more tart and refined on the palate, where zesty but full apple and pear flavors run the show. Not lean but definitely streamlined and acidic.

111173,111173,Spain,"Shows good fruit aromas, moderate depth and a touch of sandalwood on the nose. The palate features ripe blackberry and chocolate, while the feel is cushioned and chewy.

111178,111178,Spain,"This rendition of Segura Viudas's off-dry bubbly is nice and yeasty, with plenty of baked apple pie and buttered toast on the nose.

111270,111270,Spain,"A lot of dill and coconut on the nose, and that dill character remains on the palate and finish.

111451,111451,Spain,"Patience is a must to make it through this burly, earthy, almost murky blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon.

112057,112057,Spain,"As under-$10 sparklers go, you'd be hard-pressed to find better than this medium-bodied and toasty version from Catalonia's White Castle. The nose is mildly yeasty but basic, while the palate deals juicy apple and white-grape flavors propelled by fresh acidity. Virtuous yet basic. But who's complaining?",Extra Brut,87,8.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
112070,112070,Spain,"A little bit sweet and doughy, but hardly offputting. Deep flavors of cherry, raspberry and strawberry control the palate, while the finish is chocolaty and long.

112076,112076,Spain,"Sweet and fresh smelling, with aromas of lime, pear and peach. The palate is all about citrus, with some spice and mineral thrown in for good measure. Balanced and zesty, like Albariño should be.",,87,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Mar de Frades
112079,112079,Spain,"Consistency at a good price is what this textbook cava is all about. The bouquet offers your basic fruit-cocktail aromas, while the palate is sort of plump as it pours on the nectarine and ripe peach flavors. Easygoing, with some weight and roundness.",Carta Nevada Brut,87,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet

112097,112097,Spain,"This wine proves that “organic” doesn't automatically translate into great. The nose is leathery and sweet, with red licorice and peanut aromas.

112100,112100,Spain,"A heavy, awkward, rather tasteless blend of Viura and Malvasia. And it's barrel fermented from a hot year. So just imagine the weight.

112105,112105,Spain,"This medium-sweet wine has a lot of issues. First off, it smells like cooked bananas. Next, the palate is like mango cotton candy.

112200,112200,Spain,"A little more herbal, stalky and tomato-influenced than the riper, fresher 2005, but still an elegant, complex wine that shines a positive light on this little-known region at the base of the Pyrenees. Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.",Blecua,90,100.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Red Blend,Viñas del Vero

Drinkable now and good for another four or five years.",Reserva,90,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Beronia
112326,112326,Spain,"If you catch this wine young and properly chilled, it isn't that bad. It's very sweet and sugary, with candied melon, mango and citrus flavors. Then it gets more tropical on the finish, with ending notes of banana and mango. On the verge of tasting fake but not quite.",Satinela Medium-Sweet,84,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
112333,112333,Spain,"Hot and earthy, with herbal aromas sitting in front of a hard, grabby palate. The flavors show more plum skin and sourness than sweet, ripe juice. Hence the wine is narrow and fairly astringent. On the plus side, it seems natural and typical for what Cariñena produces.",No. IV,83,22.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Red Blend,Gabarda
112334,112334,Spain,"Despite a fairly positive bouquet, the mouthfeel is tight and the flavor profile is narrow. Sheer across the palate with hard cherry and mild citrus flavors. There's no shortage of tannin either on this young red.",No. II,83,14.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Red Blend,Gabarda
112355,112355,Spain,"Red fruit is the focus of this zesty, rugged Tempranillo-based wine. The palate is lively and acidic, as plum and berry flavors get lots of boost.

112356,112356,Spain,"Hay, corn and buttered toast are the initial aromas, and soon after the wine settles into a pretty good groove. The palate is pure and sweet, with sticky, ripe fruit flavors that veer toward fruit cocktail and mango but never turn cloying. This wine handles its sugar like a pro.",Semi-Seco,87,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
112360,112360,Spain,"A wave of pleasant but light cherry, blackberry and sage offers a powerful but not overpowering opening.

112363,112363,Spain,"Warm and the slightest bit raisiny, but overall it's a bright, fruity blend of Monastrell and Tempranillo that's tasty and worth every dollar.

112518,112518,Spain,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth. Saturated but also somewhat monotone and single-leveled in terms of flavor, where you get a narrow band of sweet black cherry and raisin in front of a short finish. Very nice as always, but not the best Allende we've reviewed.",Allende,89,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
112528,112528,Spain,"A well-made and refreshing wine for the price. The nose is crisp and smells of nettles, grapefruit, cilantro and stony minerals, while the feel is zesty and the flavors bring a mix of green fruits, citrus and tropicality.

112530,112530,Spain,"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing.

112593,112593,Spain,"Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews.

112598,112598,Spain,"Rather minty and herbal up front, with grassy, field-like aromas overriding the red fruit that wants to peek through.

Acceptable but doesn't offer much.",Mercedes Eguren Rosé,83,13.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Eguren
112608,112608,Spain,"Past its prime. The nose is heavy and the palate deals minimal peach flavors. It's wet but losing clarity, with bland apple and pear flavors left on the finish. This is not quite dead but best to wait for 2007.",,83,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Castro Baroña
112657,112657,Spain,"The nose kicks up ginger ale and a touch of lime, and that's followed by apple and mild citrus flavors.

112667,112667,Spain,"Lemon peel and zesty raspberry aromas greet you, and next in line comes a mouthful of sharp red-fruit flavors that are tangy and juicy.

112678,112678,Spain,"Very round and candied, with a ton of vanilla on the nose. It's made in the supersweet style, as if it's supposed to go with wedding cake or caramel bon bons.

113283,113283,Spain,"Classic in color, and backed by aromatics of lavender, graphite and pure blackberry. This is not overly weighty, as the acidity keeps it pointed and pure.

113285,113285,Spain,"What a superb combination of new oak, leather, mineral, mocha and berry fruit this wine delivers.

114323,114323,Spain,"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather.

Not currently imported.",Malón de Echaide Crianza,87,,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodega del Romero
114324,114324,Spain,"Dried fruit, a touch of compost and then bold coffee and mocha aromas give the wine a decent nose, and the palate, while zesty and snappy, is endowed with pretty good raspberry, cherry and strawberry flavors.

114361,114361,Spain,"Black raspberry and raisin control the bouquet on this carbonically macerated wine from inland Valencia.

114369,114369,Spain,"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level.

114372,114372,Spain,"Hits with force as well as notes of raisin and Sherry. No doubt this comes from a hot vintage, evidenced by the prune, brandied cherry and chocolate flavors.

115284,115284,Spain,"A Priorat blend made in a softer, more simple style. The nose has plum, prune, licorice and rooty scents, which precedes a thick, sweet palate that has mild tannic grip and flavors of raisin, black plum and wild berry. Plump and broad, with good depth.",Isaral,87,46.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Prior Pons
115288,115288,Spain,"Good for a mature wine but it does smell a bit flat and damp. That murkiness blows off somewhat, leaving a solid, aged Rioja wine with acidic zap and lightly baked berry, cherry, tomato and spice flavors. Mild on the finish. Drink now.",Gran Reserva,87,40.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramirez de la Piscina
115289,115289,Spain,"Earthy smelling, with slightly murky baked berry aromas. The palate is juicy and snappy, with strawberry and raspberry flavors that carry a bit of richness.

Reliable as always.",Vendimia Seleccionada Crianza,87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Marqués de Cáceres
115294,115294,Spain,"In the past we've found this wine to be a bit flat and overwooded, but the '04 is balanced, fresh and downright lovely. Light vanilla and toast shadings accent bright peach and melon flavors, and the texture is something to behold. Excluding Valdeorras, this is Galician white wine in its most refined state.",Barrica,91,21.0,Galicia,Ribeiro,,White Blend,Viña Mein
115297,115297,Spain,"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish.",,91,22.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Pazo de Señorans
115303,115303,Spain,"A powerful wine with forceful minerality. Still, it's loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapple/mango category.

115327,115327,Spain,"Two vintages running this is good, even-flowing rosé. The color is on the red side, but the nose dials in on fluffy red-berry aromas.

115333,115333,Spain,"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Reserva,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo Blend,Malumbres
115336,115336,Spain,"Opens with marshmallow-like sweetness on the nose, but that changes to lean fruit and saline with time. The palate is solid and zesty, with standard Rioja-style plum, berry and dill flavors. It's a fresh but quiet wine, with a tight body, medium tannins and pretty good flavors. Well done but nothing unusual.",Reserva,86,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Montecillo
115338,115338,Spain,"Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact. It starts with fresh peachy aromas and then comes on with light berry and peach flavors. Arguably a bit candied, but perfectly good for summer quaffing.",Rosado,86,9.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Ochoa
115346,115346,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish.

115410,115410,Spain,"A sweet, raisiny old-vines Garnacha with candied aromas and a fat, chunky body that houses soft, short black fruit and peppery flavors.

115426,115426,Spain,"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry. That all indicates that it's not overdone, and thus the tobacco, earth and dried fruit flavors are par for the course. Dry and leafy on the finish, which indicates that now is the time to get at it.",Real de Aragón Centenaria,86,18.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Garnacha,Pagos Familia Langa
115430,115430,Spain,"Darker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather.

115435,115435,Spain,"Definitely an herbal wine, with tomato, oregano, pizza sauce and savory aromas. The palate has good snap and verve to it, while the feel is on the lean side.

115509,115509,Spain,"Opens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors.

115511,115511,Spain,"Fresh berry aromas carry some spice notes, while the palate is rugged and a little hot.

Spunky and clean, with honest flavors.",Urban Ribera,86,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
115518,115518,Spain,"A solid but seemingly standard blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha with berry and cherry aromas along with touches of mint and leather. The palate is woody, with spiced berry flavors and decent body and structure. Vanilla and then oak-based bitterness define the finish. A good wine but hardly a knockout.",Corpus del Muni Roble,86,20.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas del Muni
115519,115519,Spain,"Tight and largely neutral white fruit aromas show a little apple but little more. The palate is friendly and easy, with melon as the lead flavor. Turns more citrusy and weighty on the finish, which fades fast.",Viña do Campo,86,18.0,Galicia,Ribeiro,,White Blend,Bodegas Docampo
115523,115523,Spain,"One of the best $7 wines you'll find from Spain.

115591,115591,Spain,"Full, roasted and earthy on the nose, with only some coconut and berry aromas to sweeten things up. Tight, level and structured in the mouth, with roasted raspberry and plum along with oaky, buttery, smoky accents that confirm the wine's “roble” designation. Good but with some excess oak to process.",,86,18.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Peña Roble
115594,115594,Spain,"Floral, spicy, semi-oaky aromas precede a tangy, fresh, higher-acid palate with snappy raspberry and red cherry flavors.

115595,115595,Spain,"Aromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it.

115607,115607,Spain,"Aromas of fresh tomato, citrus peel and red fruits are a touch austere, but the mouth and flavors are more generous.

115688,115688,Spain,"Light and dominated by red fruit from the nose to the palate to the finish. Along the way are edgy accents of spice, stem, citrus and dry oak.

115691,115691,Spain,"Starts with punchbowl aromas of berry fruit, flowery scents and candy. The palate has a good freshness to it along with snap and flavors of cherry, plum and berry.

115693,115693,Spain,"Opens with good berry fruit aromas, mineral notes and coconutty sweetness, which is followed by a plump, well-balanced palate of black fruits, plum and licorice.

115694,115694,Spain,"On the plus side, there's a smoky, meaty set of aromas. But on the down side, there's a rubbery character reminiscent of burnt tire tread. That rubbery element passes through to the flavors, which also bring roasted berry into the fold.

115695,115695,Spain,"Begins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors.

115696,115696,Spain,"Roasted and mildly leafy, and then clacky and a bit tannic in the mouth.

115698,115698,Spain,"This new wine from the Torres group is a little heavy and baked on the nose, but once you get it onto the palate there's depth, mouthfeel and solid flavors of savory fruit, soy, rubber and dark berry.

115784,115784,Spain,"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas.

115794,115794,Spain,"Standard black-cherry aromas carry a candied, vanilla-like twinge, while the feel is juicy and snappy.

115871,115871,Spain,"A better wine than the label's varietal Garnacha, so it seems as though the Tempranillo brings character and elevation.

115874,115874,Spain,"A little bit dark and crusty on the bouquet, with murky, earthy black cherry aromas that get clearer and cleaner with air.

115884,115884,Spain,"Dusty, lightly oaked berry aromas are entirely regular, while the berry driven palate is dry, drawing and oaky, with pretty good body but stand-out acidity as well.

115953,115953,Spain,"Super dense and hard as a rock, with bacon and black fruit aromas that lead straight to a saturated, chewy, tannic palate that pounds away as it delivers blackberry, coffee, licorice and other huge flavors. As big, baked and heavy as they come, with gargantuan tannins. Includes 15% Syrah in addition to Monastrell.",Cármine,85,30.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Bodegas Murtia
115974,115974,Spain,"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam.

115977,115977,Spain,"Lightly stemmy and brambly, with lean red fruit aromas, a touch of saline and red licorice candy.

115979,115979,Spain,"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef.

116043,116043,Spain,"Uncomplicated and dominated by red fruit aromas and flavors. This is your everyday type of red wine that could probably be made from just about any grape or blend of grapes.

116047,116047,Spain,"A little herbal and minty on the nose, but at this price one can't complain too mightily.

116048,116048,Spain,"Heavy, minty and smelling of shoe polish, barrel char and black licorice. The palate is chunky but overall it has pretty good structure.

116057,116057,Spain,"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems.

116130,116130,Spain,"Dark and chunky, but also salinic and clammy smelling, with black fruit aromas sitting in front of a palate of salinic, woody, baked fruit flavors.

116506,116506,Spain,"While this wine doesn't really appeal to us, we can envision fans of Old World, leaner, more acidic wines signing on.

117677,117677,Spain,"Not every swing for the fences is rewarded with a home run. This wine, from a hot year, spent 22 months in oak. Thus it's a firebomb of dark, medicinal fruit mixed with root beer, lemon peel and creamy chocolate.

117685,117685,Spain,"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate. Surrounding that is sizable fruit and oak, the latter of which adds dill to the fray.

117703,117703,Spain,"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you.

117713,117713,Spain,"Verdejo and Viura comprise this mineral- and pepper-tinged wine. The palate is clean but a touch blanced out and drying. Flavors of citrus, apple and banana transform into walnut and aging cider on the finish.",Verdejo-Viura,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,White Blend,Vacceos
117716,117716,Spain,"Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return.

117734,117734,Spain,"Big, bulky and struggling for balance. The alcohol is 15.5% and we can't say that it wears it well.

117736,117736,Spain,Simple on the nose and like biting into a green apple when you taste it. There isn't much structure or grab to the wine; it's more like a wet wash of the mouth that finishes like ginger ale. An easy game to solve; drink now.,,83,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Orballo
117754,117754,Spain,"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Fino Light,83,15.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Harveys
117771,117771,Spain,"Cola, cherry and mint aromas give reason for optimisim, but the palate is extraordinarily hard and acidic.

117819,117819,Spain,"In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit.

118293,118293,Spain,"Opens with vinaigrette and balsamic notes along with leather and black fruit aromas. The palate is soft and muddled, with soupy, stewy flavors and a jagged, candied finish.

118448,118448,Spain,"Concentrated to the max, with young, closed aromas of coconut, charcoal, mint leaf, leather, hot pavement and black fruit.

Drink now through 2011.",Edición Limitada,90,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
122223,122223,Spain,"Aromas of rubber, leafy red fruit and herbal raspberry are solid. It's crisp in the mouth, with raspy tannins supporting tight cherry and raspberry flavors. Finishes like it flows, with firm acidity and zest more than richness, leaving a hint of creamy vanilla and heat as it fades away.",Criança,87,48.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Morlanda
122224,122224,Spain,"Muga has crafted a steely, no-fat Viura (with 10% Malvasia), despite the wine being fermented in barrel. The nose is clean and passive, while the palate is crisp and tight but largely neutral in its delivery of apple and lemon flavors. From a cool vintage, this wine is like kissing the razor's edge. Good stuff but limited in what it has in store.",Barrel Fermented,87,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Muga
122225,122225,Spain,"The unheralded Tarragona D.O. delivers a basic winner in this varietal Tempranillo. It comes out of the gate well, with deep cherry, kirsch and coffee aromas. The palate falls off a touch from the promise of the bouquet, but overall the wine is generous and fruity and sincere. More balanced and complex than one might expect from a Catalonian value-priced red.",Old Vines,87,11.0,Catalonia,Tarragona,,Tempranillo,Nostrada
122232,122232,Spain,"Citrusy on the nose, with just a hint of sulfuric burn and smoke. Flavors of sweet white grapefruit, tangerine and tarragon leaf give the palate that little bit extra, while the finish is smooth but short. Good but a touch flat on the back end and finish.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,87,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
122234,122234,Spain,"Both Freixenet and its sister property Segura Viudas put out myriad Cavas in this price and quality range. This one shows cherry candy on the nose and some seltzer. The palate is balanced between sweet red fruit and citrus, while the finish is dry despite some earlier sweetness. Bouncy and nice for a Pinot Noir Cava.",Aria Brut,87,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
122249,122249,Spain,"Nothing outrageous but this Garnacha, which now has a little age on it, is more than satisfying. The nose delivers cherry, plum and even a little cookie, while the savory palate features molasses, plum and spice. Subtle, composed and sort of old-school. Drink now.",Selección Reserva,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Bodegas Alconde
122326,122326,Spain,"Pure and forward, with minerally aromas of citrus, grapefruit and wet stone. For basic Verdejo, this is head and shoulders above most; it bursts with fresh orange, grapefruit, green apple and peach, and the finish is pure and long. So tasty and super easy to like; a highly recommended go-to value white.",,90,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Naia
122502,122502,Spain,"A smoky number with vibrant aromas of dried fruits mixed with campfire and molasses. It's integrated and spicy, with cherry, apple-peel and other attractive secondary flavors.

122512,122512,Spain,"Not many wines of this price are pulling legit 90-point scores. But this one deserves it.

122586,122586,Spain,"Rubbery, meaty and fully ripe smelling: that's the nose on this round and dark Monastrell. Yet while it hints at being bold and burly, the palate is more restrained and subtle. Don't expect a ton of stuffing, and instead look for savory plum and olive flavors in front of a short, stout finish. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",,86,14.0,Levante,Yecla,,Monastrell,Castillo del Barón
122590,122590,Spain,"There's nothing not to like about this affordable Spanish bubbly. The nose is a little candied and shy, but it's pleasant overall.

Fresh yet soft, simple and easygoing.",Carta Nevada Brut,86,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
122592,122592,Spain,"Good but basic wine from southern Spain that shows cherry aromas with a citrusy twist.

122593,122593,Spain,"Campo de Borja's “everyman's” red rides again in 2007. Sure, it's sweet and candied, but that's the 75% Garnacha talking. Flavors of berry, plum and chocolate are bold and forward, though not very complex. Seems more lush and heavy than in the past. Good for those who don't want to think much about what they're drinking.",,86,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Red Blend,Borsao
122603,122603,Spain,"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",,86,17.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Dom Bardo
122604,122604,Spain,"A little cloudy and minty, with aromas of herbs and reeds bumping up against cherry cough drop. That medicinal cherry flavor joins plum and light pepper, while the feel is lively, bracing and forward. Gets better with airing, and overall it tastes a little more natural than some Jumilla heavyweights.",Monasterio de Santa Ana,86,12.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Casa de la Ermita
122605,122605,Spain,"Stylistically speaking, this oak-aged wine is very different from all of Borsao's fruit-first Garnachas. And that isn't exactly a full-out compliment. So while the wine has balance and structure, the oak seems dominant on the nose and palate, which lends more vanilla and cream than spice and character.",Crianza Selección,86,16.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Red Blend,Borsao
122606,122606,Spain,"Quintessential value wine from Spain is what you're getting with Viña Borgia's 100% Garnacha. The nose is candied for sure, but it settles to show the upside of Grenache rather than the weaker, more remedial side.

122638,122638,Spain,"A tough, sun-belted wine with concentration, big tannins and a ton of power and flavor. The nose is all bacon, balsamic notes, tobacco and roasted black fruit, while the ridged palate is dark and tastes of blackberry, molasses, coconut and brown sugar. Edgy, lemony and tannic on the finish. Drink now with beef; can be held for another 3–5 years.",Cenit Old Vines,90,48.0,Northern Spain,Tierra del Viños de Zamora,,Tempranillo,Viñas del Cenit
122784,122784,Spain,"Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014.",Amancio,95,167.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
122892,122892,Spain,"Ginger ale and a touch of powdered sugar give this extra dry Cava its proper sweet aromas. The flavors are solid, if you like candied orange slices and lemon-lime soda. Shows good mouthfeel and more than adequate freshness. Perfectly competent given that it's $9.",Extra Dry,86,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
122895,122895,Spain,"The bouquet delivers some of that creamy, corn-like smell that many Cavas show. There is also cereal and citrus to the nose.

Shows some green bitterness on the finish.",Brut de Bruts,86,20.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Gran Rigau
122898,122898,Spain,"Probably not a Cava for wine snobs. But who says all wines have to be super serious and complex?

Best with birthday cake, etc.",Spumante,86,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
122906,122906,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see.

A good wine, but a basic one.",,86,18.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Vionta
122907,122907,Spain,"Gets off early with fresh tomato, spiced red plum, tobacco and vanilla aromas. The palate is fine but tight, with herbal fruit flavors, pepper, tomato and sharp acidity.

122978,122978,Spain,"Baked, earthy and leathery, just like all the AN wines. But there's also a smooth intersection of the old and new worlds here; it's one part rooty, oaky and rich but also dry, leathery and indigenous to the Balearics (the base grape is Callet).

122987,122987,Spain,"A more traditional type of crianza with vanilla, spice, dry berry fruit and a quiet, subtle approach. The mouthfeel is Old World with it's clean, dusty weight and proper acid-tannin balance, and the flavors of spice, cherry, dried currant and earth don't overstep their place. Very nice wine for under $20.",Crianza,89,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Valserrano
122998,122998,Spain,"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes.

123065,123065,Spain,"Deep and dark as night, with a lake's worth of cassis and black fruit aromas. There is no interference here; just pure, big-boned, modern-style Tempranillo flavors of currants, blackberry and soft, cuddly oak. Finishes with cream and coconut, but length and power as well.

123087,123087,Spain,"Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors.

Drinkable now and good through 2013.",La Viña de Andres Romeo,94,166.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Benjamin Romeo
123169,123169,Spain,"A slightly heavier version of Verdejo, especially given 2007's cool conditions in Rueda. The wine has waxy peach and papaya aromas follwed by apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. It definitely opens on the palate and then finishes with a fleshy texture, additional fruit and even some nuts. Good complexity yet still a forward type of white wine.",Fuente Elivra,89,14.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
123171,123171,Spain,"Dry, smoky and showing a touch of leather, this is a smooth crianza with bright berry flavors, a bit of heft, and well-applied oak that doesn't overwhelm. Black cherry and raspberry flavors are bright, and the vanilla and butter elements are controlled and should subside in due time. Drink now into 2010.",Viña Real Plata Crianza,89,21.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
123180,123180,Spain,"The nose delivers a light but perceptible blast of sucking candy, children's vitamin and perfume aromas.

123183,123183,Spain,"The smell of honey and lemon-lime soda give this a basic but respectable opening. It's sort of foamy and plump in the mouth, with apple and green-herb flavors.

123186,123186,Spain,"The neon pink color is a dead giveaway that Garnacha is the basis of this rosé. Smells spunky and quite fresh on the nose, with a touch of bubble-gum sweetness.

123188,123188,Spain,"A little aggressive out of the chute, with a nose that's sort of raspy. The fruit on the palate is tangy and tastes like early picked nectarines with a lemon twist.

123190,123190,Spain,"Age is beginning to show up on this gran reserva. It's a little raisiny and Sherried on the nose, while the palate is wiry but not exactly thin, with dry raspberry, pie cherry and plum skin flavors.

123192,123192,Spain,"Aromas of cherry-chocolate and rubber are firm and a little closed. And such a bouquet doesn't really portend a flavor profile dominated by pink grapefruit and tight citrus.

123193,123193,Spain,"Savory and deep given the price, with dark color, obvious ripeness and even a touch of vanilla and mocha on the nose.

123251,123251,Spain,"Interesting and very much showing Navarran qualities, including aromas of black olive, herbs and mossy fruit.

123260,123260,Spain,"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas.

123266,123266,Spain,"A different breed of blended wine, with earthy aromas of dried cheese, leather, dill and vanilla.

123374,123374,Spain,"Oddly, this is preferable to El Nido's $140 Cab-heavy fruit bomb. Maybe that's because Monastrell is the go-to grape in Jumilla, and this is 70% Monastrell and only 30% Cab compared to the opposite with El Nido. All that said, this wine is ripe, approachable and dark, with excellent balance and a fudgy, warm finish of fruitcake and blackberry.

123378,123378,Spain,"Starts with the scent of beef on the grill, and then folds in black fruit and fine aged cheese.

123450,123450,Spain,"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak.

123451,123451,Spain,"Silly name but pretty good wine. A tidal wave of cherry/berry aromas is authentic, natural, youthful and floral.

A touch of mineral and chocolate at the end gives it some darkness to match the vibrancy.",,85,8.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Wrongo Dongo
123453,123453,Spain,"Even though it's a sweet-styled Cava, the nose kicks up lemon and apple aromas that are familiar as can be.

123461,123461,Spain,"Ultra purple and sort of gummy and confected. But it's also pretty solid in the mouth, with tannin instead of flatness holding things together.

123462,123462,Spain,"The Borsao brand is a bargain pioneer, and while the wines aren't $4.99 anymore they are still squarely “value” oriented.

123577,123577,Spain,"A delicious wine and very much the model for value in Spanish Garnacha. That this has 25% Tempranillo only seems to make it better; the nose is sweet but full and plummy.

123591,123591,Spain,"Nutty and toasty, with toffee and butter pecan aromas. The palate is wet, light, alert and snappy, but also angular and citrusy.

Finishes fresh but lean.",,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo,Rivera de Castilla
124087,124087,Spain,"Black licorice, mint and a hint of raisin work the nose. However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. To drink now it'll need to go with food. If given plenty of airing or decanting it'll show its best.",Tinto,88,38.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo Blend,Pesquera
124094,124094,Spain,"The aromas of sarsparilla, tree bark, dried raspberry and cumin take you back to traditional Rioja winemaking. With lighter-weight fruit, herb and tomato leaf flavors, this is a solid old-school wine that will hit the right marks with tapas or roast meats. It's got some tea and tang as well, courtesy of zesty acids.",Gran Reserva,88,34.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
124241,124241,Spain,"An opening of apricot and peach aromas is proper, while the palate delivers a jolt of zest and acidity to more pineapple, lime and punchy green-apple flavors. Tangy later on, with more than a drop of lemon and lime to the finish. Also slightly pithy and bitter, which is natural for Godello.",,88,18.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Godello,Abad Dom Bueno
124246,124246,Spain,"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",,88,16.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Lícia
124259,124259,Spain,"Shy at first, with standard raspberry aromas, earth and buttery notes along with cherry and raspberry flavors.

124262,124262,Spain,"Full, heavy, chunky wine with a powerful bouquet of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is about as full and concentrated as they come, but there's good balance and aging potential along with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal shadings. Savory and strong as it is long on the finish. Drinkable now but better from 2011–2014.",VS Reserva,91,100.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Red Blend,Val Sotillo
124364,124364,Spain,"Fresh-cut oak is front and center on this now-aging blend of Monastrell and Merlot. There's a green, almost cheesy accent to the nose, which is followed by generic plum flavor. Always resiny and creamy due to the oak, with some prune to the finish.",Enciro Monastrell Merlot,84,10.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,El Bully
124372,124372,Spain,"Mildly raw and reduced, but at $6 expectations shouldn't be too high. In the mouth, it's tangy and light, with zingy strawberry/raspberry flavors that have some scour. Bland but lively.",,83,6.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
124375,124375,Spain,"Raw and rough more than flush or lush. The nose deals mildly pickled red-fruit aromas in front of a tight, acidic palate that tastes of pie cherries.

124376,124376,Spain,"Fizzy and foamy and aggressive. To give it a frame of reference, it is similar to Brachetto or Frascati from Italy, but it's clumsy on the palate and tastes too much like red licorice and candied fruit to be taken too seriously. Also a bit cloying on the finish. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.",Reynal Vino de Aguja,83,10.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Rosé,Pinord
124390,124390,Spain,"For a large-production Rioja, this sings the proper notes and shiould please almost anyone with a taste for Spanish red wines. It's violet in color, indicating good ripeness.

Drink now.",Crianza,88,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
124475,124475,Spain,"Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.",Dama de Toro,88,11.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
124481,124481,Spain,"Comes out of the chute with some aggression, but that's settled by quality apple and grassy aromas.

As a whole, this is good cava.",Brut,88,17.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra
124485,124485,Spain,"This is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.",Crianza,88,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Ramón Bilbao
124487,124487,Spain,"Dusty lemon and cidery aromas are solid and draw you in. The palate has a fresh, clean feel and lively, tangy flavors of citrus, green fruits and green herbs.

124495,124495,Spain,"Dark and fully oaked Rioja with vanilla, mocha, char and black-fruit aromas.

124569,124569,Spain,"Warm, earthy aromas of molasses, moss and baked fruit scream rich and big, and the palate matches that early announcement with cola, baked blackberry, coffee and syrupy flavors.

124578,124578,Spain,"A serious, oak-influenced Godello with smooth aromas of baked apple, wood resin, vanilla, spice and green melon. The palate has weight and fine acidity, so it's tight despite delivering a blast of oaky flavor. Alongside that resiny taste, there's green banana and peach notes. Fresh but woody; should age well for at least another 18 months.",,90,30.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Avanthia
124581,124581,Spain,"A round, chewy wine with a nice mix of black fruit, vanilla, aged cheese and light balsam wood on the nose.

124650,124650,Spain,"Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon is the blend and it's showing some age. The nose is a little heavy and murky, and so is the palate.

124655,124655,Spain,"All over the map. The nose offers toast offset by gym sweat, while the palate is both tangy yet pickled, with zingy orange flavors.

124656,124656,Spain,"Big in color, with meaty, rubbery aromas that seem reduced and gaseous. The palate is black and toasty, but sort of rubbery.

124664,124664,Spain,"A bit too rubbery and gassy to qualify as “clean,” with leafiness running the bouquet. The palate is sort of flat, with raisin, baked cherry and prune flavors. It's on the borderline of being stewed.",Tinto,83,9.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,,Red Blend,Bodegas Agustín Cubero
124668,124668,Spain,"Not super fruity. Instead it's a generic, racy specimen with lots of zap, kick and zest but not much style, warmth or fruit. Shows fiery flavors and a tight, driving finish. Expect many 2007s, including this one, to be on the miserly side.",,83,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Campellares
124670,124670,Spain,"As a young wine, this is bold, dark, crusty and slightly out of joint. There are salty, balsamic flavors along with muscular berry notes, and then butter and other barrel-driven flavors on the finish. It's chunky bordering on huge, with balance and integration issues. Maybe a little better in six months.",Saludo,83,11.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga
124672,124672,Spain,"Gummy, pasty and sweet, with no real elegance or finesse. It's simply a dark, candied wine that's pure tutti-frutti. And the feel is more narrow than one might hope for given the wine's immense color and body.",El Chaparral Old Vine,82,13.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Grenache,Vega Sindoa
124679,124679,Spain,"Toasty and rubbery aromas lead to a drastic, rather sharp palate of brazen red cherry and plum. More tang and pickled than rich and rewarding, with a fiery mouthfeel and scouring acidity.",,82,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,El Circulo
124692,124692,Spain,"Here's a wine that manages to blend classic notes of dryness, fine acidity and red fruit with modern weight, ripeness, oak and color. It's not otherwordly but it does pass all the tests. The fruit is fine but regular, while the finish hints at licorice and chocolate. A no-frills winner without a lot of fanfare.",Reserva,88,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Murrieta
124695,124695,Spain,"During the harvest last fall winemaker and owner Vicki Pariente said 2007 would be a lean year in Rueda with some great wines. Hers is very pungent and full of nettles, sweat and other cool-climate symptoms. Which doesn't make it a bad wine; just tight, lean and green.

124800,124800,Spain,"Brickish in color, with mature aromas of cedar, pine, tobacco, olive and dried fruits.

124805,124805,Spain,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Single Vineyard,88,18.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Finca de Arantei
124810,124810,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with a pinch of rubber, earth, smoked beef and plum/prune. The palate offers structure, solid acidity, zestiness and bright flavors of cherry and raspberry.

124811,124811,Spain,"While I prefer the 2009 for its clarity and freshness, this '08 is no slouching tiger.

124823,124823,Spain,"Mineral, lime and crisp apple aromas give it a precise, pure nose.

124865,124865,Spain,"An interesting, well-made wine with distinct barrel notes.

124880,124880,Spain,"Full, earthy and ripe, but also delivering alot of clean fruit, size and balance.

124960,124960,Spain,"Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit.

125778,125778,Spain,"A solid, serious Rioja reserva with licorice, leather, char and good berry aromas. The palate is juicy, pure and tastes of clean black cherry and cola flavors. Picks up steam as it opens up, and then finishes with a light butter streak and proper weight. No complaints; almost makes the upper echelon. Drink now through 2012.",Cosme Palacio y Hermanos Reserva,89,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
125788,125788,Spain,"Classic Verdejo that won't wow but will definitely get your palate going.

125975,125975,Spain,"This vintage rosado is as good as always, but a bit lower on the quality ladder than previous years.

125978,125978,Spain,"Normally this producer's high-end Sherries are outstanding, but this Amontillado is aggressive and hard, with a clod-like character that starts with molasses on the nose and then turns toward sharpness and bitterness on the palate. Try as I might, this one strikes me as good but loud, hard, forceful and lacking the suavity that great Sherries possess.",Del Duque Amontillado Muy Viejo,87,45.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
125980,125980,Spain,"This is your quintessential simple quaff among brut cavas. It's clean, lime-tinged and soda-like on the nose, with a correct, no-issues palate that pushes zesty apple along with sweet papaya, mango and banana flavors.

125982,125982,Spain,"Slightly low on kick and bubbles for a blanc de blancs, but the wine's mix of green herb, apple, green banana and melon flavors is good and offers the proper set up to a finish that's citrusy as can be and only slightly pithy. Seems a touch flat or it might have rated even higher.",Brut Blanc de Blancs,87,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
125984,125984,Spain,"Dusty, slightly candied aromas are briary and pretty good, and overall it's giving freshness, pop and red-fruit flavors touched up by dill, nutmeg and vanilla.

125987,125987,Spain,"Starts out with roasted, stewy, beefy aromas and not much brightness. The palate is measured and healthy, with dry raspberry, currant and medicinal plum flavors.

In a nutshell, it's a good, standard, respectable Rioja that will complement almost any food.",Reserva,87,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Solabal
125990,125990,Spain,"A heavy, slightly strained wine that has a lot in tow. The nose is smoky, rubbery like an inner tube, and a bit herbal.

Very much on the ripe side, with a full tannic bite.",Lanzaga,87,34.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Telmo Rodríguez
125992,125992,Spain,"Initially it's rugged, but airing reveals black-cherry aromas and dry spice.

125995,125995,Spain,"Good on the nose, with solid raspberry and nectarine aromas. The palate is spunky and alert, with juicy red-cherry, rhubarb and integrated spice flavors. It's mostly a clean, basic, easy-to-drink bubbly, but it's persistent, harmonious and commendable.

125997,125997,Spain,"Aromas of apple cider and mild spice get it going in a good direction, and this colorfully packaged cava does pretty well in the mouth, where the texture is on the soft side and the flavors of apple and orange run a bit sweet. Not complex but good, fluffy and yeasty.",Lady of Spain Brut,87,15.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
126060,126060,Spain,"Definitely a once-ripe, raisiny wine with hard Toro tannins and molasses aromas and flavors. Borderline syrupy but with enough structure and grip to make the grade.

126062,126062,Spain,"Bold and chunky Ribera wine with black fruit aromas that don't tread lightly.

126067,126067,Spain,"Full, ripe and so tannic in its present form that it's scratchy and hard on the mouth.

126074,126074,Spain,"Peachy, mildly sweet, smooth and inviting. Godeval always makes a true and easy wine that showcases the essence of Godello but doesn't go off the blueprint.

126278,126278,Spain,"A touch raisiny and sweet from nose to tail, but what's in between is convincing for Jumilla.

126286,126286,Spain,"For Spanish Chardonnay, this is perfectly good and clean. The nose brings your basic set of white-fruit, mineral and fresh herb flavors, while the palate is lively despite some dry, resiny oak flavor.

126292,126292,Spain,"This winery is known for red Mencía, but this small-lot Godello is perfectly nice and drinkable.

Only 250 cases made.",,87,22.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Godello,Luna Beberide
126297,126297,Spain,"Dusty earth and dry spice aromas blend with some char, vanilla and berry/cherry on the nose.

126368,126368,Spain,"A blend of Tempranillo with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot. Aromas of black cherry, spice, aged cheese and earth are solid, while the palate features good fruit but some weakness in structure.

126481,126481,Spain,"There's no shortage of ripe aromas: leather, berries and aged cheese. Yet the palate is quite sharp, with searing acidity sitting on top of red-berry flavors.

126509,126509,Spain,"El Coto has gotten its game in gear in recent years. The brand's value-priced wines like this Viura are clean and proper.

126680,126680,Spain,"Incognito deftly describes the unusual beet and blueberry aromas on this wine, which is a bit narrow and scracthy.

127810,127810,Spain,"Starts with distinct, hard aromas of mustard, horseradish and jerky. In the mouth, it's full, bullish and tannic, with flavors of bacon, wood resin, smoke and stewed blackberry.

It's opaque as midnight without a moon, and the nose is a delectable blend of vanilla, spice, hickory, mocha and meaty blackberry. The palate is both magnetic and sly; it pumps black fruit galore, but augments things with controlled chocolate and spice. Finishes a mile long, with cream, intensity and guile.

129469,129469,Spain,"Best on the nose, but sharp and narrow as can be on the palate. Cranberry and sour cherry flavors dominate, while the finish is astringent. No amount of swirling and saving is going help it much.",Oak Aged,80,17.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Tempranillo-Merlot,Reula
129514,129514,Spain,"Starts out murky, gassy and challenged, and while it does emerge from that cloud it remains little more than bargain-priced, borderline Tempranillo from an obscure central Spain region.

129523,129523,Spain,"Generally speaking, most Amontillados are good at their worst, but for whatever reason this wine barely makes the grade. It lacks pop on the nose and seems dilute and drab.

Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine.

131491,131491,Spain,"Spice, herbs, smoked meat and a dark core work in harmony on the bouquet. The palate on this well-made Reserva packs black cherry, cassis and plum, and that's followed by a stylish, smooth finish that comes on buttery at first and then settles in. Doesn't overwhelm but complements food nicely. Tasted twice.",Reserva,90,40.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Conde de la Salceda
131492,131492,Spain,"Very colorful and properly ripe, with lush berry aromas backed by coffee notes. The palate is lush and balanced, with deep blueberry, black cherry and cola notes. A truly committed wine with a smooth, unctuous finish as the final chapter.",,90,15.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Syrah,Alceño
131500,131500,Spain,"Starts with roasted, leathery aromas that feature hints of burnt beef and berry compote. The palate is layered and nicely balanced, with berry flavors hitting first and chocolate coming next. Espresso is the final act, as it ties the mouth to the finish in impressive fashion.

131550,131550,Spain,"Dusty black cherry and raspberry aromas are true to the variety, and the buttery quality on the palate adds weight and vanilla to the berry and cassis flavors.

Will go well with steak.",Estate Bottled,88,45.0,Central Spain,Dominio de Valdepusa,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Marques de Griñon
131558,131558,Spain,"The earthy brick color and dry fruit aromas announce that this isn't a typical wine. The blend is Merlot, Callet and Syrah, and it hails from the island of Mallorca. The wine is a bit tough and angular, but the plum, raspberry and cherry flavors are tightly formed and fenced in by potent acidity and oak. Interesting but not for everyone.",Negre,88,27.0,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,,Red Blend,Son Bordils
131574,131574,Spain,"Heavily oaked and loaded down with butter and resin, this is a wine for those infatuated with the obscure. The blend is 90% Callet and 10% Fogoneu, and don't ask us to give you the history of these Mallorcan grapes. Suffice it to say that this wine is broad, a bit stewy and very different. It's not heavy like an anchor but it has its chunky shoulder pads to deal with. Only 25 cases made.",Son Negre,88,110.0,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,,Red Blend,Ànima Negra
131603,131603,Spain,"An old-school wine done really well. It starts with cherry, tobacco and light coconut aromas before moving on to juicy boysenberry and citrus flavors that are boosted by CUNE's trademark acids.

131718,131718,Spain,"Big in every way, with tons of new oak, popcorn and coffee sitting on top of dark-fruit aromas.

131720,131720,Spain,"Charcoal, cola and licorice are all components of this wine's dark and meaty nose.

131721,131721,Spain,"A bit of choppy wood announces a fully oaked wine, and yes, it's a touch hard-coated. But underneath the veneer of barrel there's lively red fruit and a natural brambly character. The palate is just acidic enough to be lively, and the finish is healthy and settles upon chocolate due to the wine's generous oaking. Very good mouthfeel and depth make this more than solid.

131728,131728,Spain,"Honey and corn syrup aromas tell you this is rich, but what you don't realize so easily is how complex and expansive this Muscat is. The flavors of honey, banana and clover start out as sweet and unctuous, but then they unfurl to show depth, complexity and length.

131737,131737,Spain,"Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas.

Well, the fact that it's varietal Petit Verdot from the Duero River Valley, which is not common; that and the fact that it's a mind-boggling $200.

131906,131906,Spain,"One of the best red wines we've tried from Alicante. It's based on Monastrell, with other grapes thrown in.

So drink soon.",Vinya La Scala Gran Reserva,86,55.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pago Jean Leon
132478,132478,Spain,"Slightly warmer in style, with caramel and vanilla aromas, yet the palate runs more toward freshness, with orange and pineapple standing out. With its good acidity and zest, this wine won't ever be called flabby. Drink now for solid results.",Montesol,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Vinos Sanz
132487,132487,Spain,"The bouquet delivers touches of graphite and rubber in front of traditional dried cherry and raspberry. Nice in the mouth, with softly fading fruit riding a wave of persistent acids and tannins. Snappy, old-school and succulent. Drink now through 2010.",Gran Reserva,89,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
132491,132491,Spain,"Dark and attractive in terms of color, with barrique-driven aromas of bacon, toast and roasted plum and berry. This is a ripe, meaty offering with blackberry, chocolate and warm brown sugar flavors supported by full tannins. Shows some licorice and burnt toast on the fairly long finish.",Flor de Grealo,89,33.0,Catalonia,Costers del Segre,,Red Blend,Vinya L'Hereu
132492,132492,Spain,"There's no shortage of barrel-driven hickory, coffee and chocolate on this modern-style Rioja, but there's also a spike of green on the nose and at the core of the flavor profile. Surrounding that is bright blackberry, amplified tannins and bursting acidity. Needs air upon opening—that, or more time in the cellar.",Coto Real Reserva,89,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,El Coto
132498,132498,Spain,"Open-cut oak, blackberry and chocolate are the opening shots in this plump, ripe, full-bodied red that is slightly tannic and chewy but impressive due to solid plum, cherry and vanilla flavors. Delivers commendable RdD quality, but $300 is shockingly expensive.",Prestigio Pago de las Solanas,89,300.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Matarromera
132499,132499,Spain,"Leans toward the modern style, with plenty of oak, bacon and plum on the bouquet. Quite upright and balanced throughout, with cherry, raspberry, cola and brown sugar for flavors. A thorough, heartily oaked Tempranillo with purity and style. Almost at the top echelon.",Reserva,89,35.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Valenciso
132534,132534,Spain,"Full and boisterous red wine, with a ton of natural ripeness and a high pleasure quotient. We have always liked the Abadal wines, and this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend gets both sides of the Old World/New World argument right. It's loaded with dark berry and earth aromas, which are followed by cola, blackberry and chocolate flavors. An alert, acid-driven wine with enough depth to impress.",Abadal Crianza,90,17.0,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Masies d'Avinyo
132573,132573,Spain,"Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents. As might be expected from a wine bearing Alvaro Palacios' signature and approval, the final product is smart and snappy, with blackberry, herbs and barrel char all making themselves noticed. Good now and for the next several years.",La Montesa,90,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Palacios Remondo
132581,132581,Spain,"A firm wine with fine structure and balance. The nose is fiery and rustic early on, then seductive as it opens up. The palate exhibits currents of raspberry, cherry and plum, and below the surface there's vanilla and brown sugar. A smooth operator that shows the Campo Viejo brand in its best light.",Gran Reserva,90,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
132618,132618,Spain,"Inky and condensed, with tough early aromas that settle on rich, sweet berry fruit.

Chewy on the finish.",Vendimia Seleccionada,87,24.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Viña Mayor
132692,132692,Spain,"Rich, dense and syrupy, but also showing touches of mint and leather on the nose. Quite sticky in the mouth, but with lovely toffee and mocha flavors that set up a finish that runs on and on.

132701,132701,Spain,"Round, stylish and wholesome on the nose, with wild berry, smoke, spice and not too much obvious oak. The palate is racy and forward, but also offers subtleties including dry fruit, spice, fresh tomato and wild herbs such as thyme and sage. Long and warm on the finish, with vanilla. Drink now through 2015.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,91,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
132708,132708,Spain,"Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.",Vendimia Seleccionada,91,59.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,García Figuero
132709,132709,Spain,"Another impressive Oloroso from Gonzalez Byass. This is a sweet, dark, brooding Sherry with prune and other sweet fruit aromas. The palate is rich but has good flow, while dark flavors of dulce de leche and burnt brown sugar are wonderful.

132716,132716,Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla. Some might call it a bit acidic and traditional, but with food it'll do great.

132721,132721,Spain,"Patience is a must to make it through this burly, earthy, almost murky blend of Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon. Early aromas of mulch and coffee morph into black fruit and leather, while initially reduced black cherry and currant flavors take on more character and depth with time. Never does it really shine, but it is a serious wine that has its merits.",Cuvée Palomar,88,48.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Abadia Retuerta
132723,132723,Spain,"One of my personal favorites among the giant collection of Freixenet cavas is the extra dry, which isn't dry in the least. Just the opposite, it's loaded with sweet apple and apricot aromas along with peach, melon and candied citrus flavors. Best of all, it maintains its poise while never falling toward cloying or sappy.",Cordon Negro Extra Dry,88,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
132727,132727,Spain,"Robust and dark, with plum and berry aromas that also carry hints of citrus and mineral. Overall this is a balanced specimen; the palate is round and full of bright plum and berry while the feel is moderately deep, somewhat tannic, and medium in acidity. Drink now.",Crianza,88,17.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Valdrinal
132732,132732,Spain,"A bit lighter on the nose than many, with notes of raspberry and strawberry.

Fruity and balanced, with a ripe, easy-to-like personality.",,88,17.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Mas Dels Frares
132733,132733,Spain,"Hard spices, smoke and tar darken up the berry nose, while the palate is round and solid, with nice berry and plum fruit.

132738,132738,Spain,"Dark in color, with brawny aromas of oak, clove and leather. In the mouth, there's a mix of black plum and cherry but also a streak of bell pepper. Finishes round, spicy, properly tannic and dark, with coffee and a light hint of green.",Viña Lanciano Reserva,87,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Bodegas LAN
132740,132740,Spain,"Bulky and a bit stewy, but still balanced enough to earn its positive points. The palate is ripe and sweet, as it oozes with black fruit. Some might call it a touch chunky, but for the most part this blend of Monastrell, Tempranillo and Syrah registers as a highly pleasurable red.",Tinto,87,10.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Alceño
132743,132743,Spain,"Sweet and spicy stuff, with plenty of oak-based coconut and butter on the nose. In the mouth, it's quite saturated and flush, with overt plum, blackberry and wood resin notes. A big, modern wine that's a bit oafish but also rather easy to drink.",Agnus Crianza,87,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Valdelana
132760,132760,Spain,"Lots of oak gives the nose a strong coconut essence, while the flavors of baked red plum and berries bring along notes of pepper and spice. This is a meaty, hot wine with maple and resin on the finish. It shows flashes of brilliance but also ruggedness and a few clumsy characteristics.",,86,82.0,Spanish Islands,Vi de la Terra Illes Balears,,Red Blend,Ribas de Cabrera
132763,132763,Spain,"In accordance to what 2003 dealt out, this wine is a bit stewy and broad. It shows cola, tree bark and baked fruit on the nose, and then sweet plum and chocolate on the finish. It's not a wine for deep contemplation; drink now to enjoy its robust plumpness.",Crianza,86,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Campos Góticos
132769,132769,Spain,A better effort than in previous years. This vintage has a tangy personality and no tricks up its sleeve.

132771,132771,Spain,"Early on the wine is dominated by buttery oak, and it's all over the nose, palate and finish. Airing settles it down, and up from the creamy underworld comes raspberry, stewed plums and chocolate. Not the thinking man's Ribera del Duero, but it gets the job done. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Crianza,86,18.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Valdubón
132779,132779,Spain,"This Garnacha- and Carignan-based wine offers a brilliant color and a true bouquet of graphite, mineral, char and black fruit. Thus expectations are high as you head to the palate, which turns out to be sheer, acidic and hard. Amid the scour you'll pull out plum and blackberry flavors. It gets it two-thirds right; the nose and color are there but the mouthfeel is lacking.",Finca El Puig,86,33.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Fuentes
132788,132788,Spain,"A slight step up from the Crianza, mostly because it's a level or two more intense. The nose is powerful, albeit full of earthy funk and leather.

132789,132789,Spain,"Wines like this are good indicators that 2004 is indeed an exceptional vintage in RdD. For a Tempranillo that spent only five months in oak it's fairly settled. The nose is a touch syrupy but you can only love the concentrated berry aromas. The mouth is bulky but satisfying, with huge dark-fruit flavors and balancing tannins and acidity. Jumpy but very likable.",Oak Aged,89,17.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Rubiejo
132798,132798,Spain,"Ripe and round, with blackberry and bacon aromas. Quite modern and full for a 2002, one of Rioja's most challenging vintages in a while.

132807,132807,Spain,"LAN's modern interpretation of Rioja is ripe, fragrant and beefy, with mineral, charcoal, pine and black cherry coating the unctuous nose. Runs a touch soft and plump on the palate, probably a reflection of the hot '03 vintage. But along the way there's black plum, licorice, molasses and maple flavors. A big, new-wave wine that has a lot going for it.",Edición Limitada,89,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas LAN
132817,132817,Spain,"Ripe, dark, a little oily and totally compelling from an aromatic standpoint. The palate is right where it should be, as neither the tannins nor the acidity are out of whack.

132837,132837,Spain,"Purple in color and meaty on the nose, with a hint of raisin and reduction but not too much. Due to the heat of 2003, this is a ripe, rich wine with big plum and berry flavors but also good balance and feel. It covers all the bases and finishes in a smooth, solid, stylish way. Just reaches the cut of excellence.",Fincas de Ganuza Reserva,90,51.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Remírez de Ganuza
132905,132905,Spain,"Robust aromas of ripe berry fruit and bacon give this a full and lusty starting point, while the textured body is rich, with sturdy tannins.

132918,132918,Spain,"Attractive, full-force plum and berry aromas with a fruity, rich, concentrated palate of black fruit and plum.

Luzon is the definition of a go-to producer.",Luzon Verde,87,9.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Bodegas Luzón
132961,132961,Spain,"A smooth and coaxing Sherry with almond and dried fruit aromas that lead perfectly to toffee and almond flavors. There's more dryness than fruit here, with peanut brittle accents and then a long, smoky finish that doesn't lose focus. Graceful Oloroso, with a nice individual character.",Cristina Oloroso Abacado,91,18.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
132977,132977,Spain,"This is nothing more than a few barrels of wine bottled by Hughes, a so-called “global vintner.” And like its Lot 128 brother, it is really good juice. Inky and floral, with blueberry and wild raspberry flavors. It's smooth, fresh, bold and finishes with mint and chocolate. Shows the positives of Campo de Borja's Garnacha.",Lot 129,90,15.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha,Cameron Hughes
132986,132986,Spain,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast.

133022,133022,Spain,"Pinot Noir-based cavas are touchy; sometimes they take on a rough, peppery personality that some might find offputting. This wine does that, but only to an extent. The nose pushes peach pit and campfire aromas, while the palate features dry fruits like papaya and melon, but with cinnamon and pepper shadings. Good mouthfeel and well made, but the flavors and aromas require some getting used to.",Brut,87,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Pinot Noir,Codorníu
133023,133023,Spain,"Brick colored, with a baked, spicy nose that is true Rioja in that it also pushes Sherry, raisin and cinnamon notes. Fairly dry, acidic and zesty in the mouth, with cherry and cola flavors. Forceful acidity keeps it moving along. Needs food to absorb that acid.",Reserva,87,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Castillo Labastida
133032,133032,Spain,"Generally speaking, this wine is nicely balanced and a bit less over the top than most 2003s. The nose shows mint, fresh herbs, graphite and berry aromas. The palate is juicy, not dull or heavy, with black cherry and dark plum flavors. Finishes almost crisp, with a shot of balancing acidity.",,87,17.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tempranillo,Tres Lunas
133036,133036,Spain,"Deep in color, falling somewhere between copper and red. The nose is forward as could be, with raspberry and a strong hint of orange blossom. Solid across the palate, with dry berry flavors and a powerful edge of pepper. Based on Pinot Noir; you can taste the essence of that variety at its core.",Aria Brut Rosé,87,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Pinot Noir,Segura Viudas
133037,133037,Spain,"With its citrusy nose and well-balanced palate, this is what Best Buy sparklers are all about.

Nice stuff.",Brut Rosé,87,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
133059,133059,Spain,"Mineral, citrus, natural vanilla and grass aromas send this still-kicking Verdejo on its way. The palate is all about apple and citrus, and the feel is more polished than edgy.

133060,133060,Spain,"Peach, nectarine and green pear aromas and flavors dominate this ripe-styled Verdejo-Viura blend.

133065,133065,Spain,"A little warmer and rounder than most. This waxy wine offers banana and melon on the nose, while the palate is just juicy and racy enough, with apple and citrus anchoring things. Finishes easy and will go well with salads and seafood.",Montesol Clásico,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,White Blend,Vinos Sanz
133072,133072,Spain,"Sulfurous early on, and then citrus and apple blossom aromas get into the game. The palate is ripe and tropical, with melon, mango and banana flavors.

133075,133075,Spain,"Berry fruit, vanilla and violet aromas are friendlier than the rugged, ultrafirm palate on this Syrah-Graciano blend. With food, the wine will be a strong counterpoint and will hold its own. By itself it may slip in pleasure points; the Graciano is tight as nails and adds astringency.

133078,133078,Spain,"Open, round and a bit rubbery, this bright-styled wine is jammy and easy to drink.

133083,133083,Spain,"Brick colored, with an earthy, gritty nose that deals leather, rhubarb and burnt fruit. The flavor package is reserved and citrusy, what some might call dilute.

133106,133106,Spain,"Typically brick-colored and oxidized, which leads to the idea that it's 25 years old already. Unique in every way: The nose is like deconstructed citrus, sherry and leather, while the palate will seem sour if compared to most other reds and zesty if you're coming off a white wine. Hard to describe; a wine for some to admire and others to say, “What the hell?”",Viña Cubillo Crianza,88,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,R. Lopez de Heredia
133108,133108,Spain,"Makes a great early impression via ripe blackberry and toast aromas. Overall there's not much negative to say about this meaty, fruity youngster; it has a lovely color, dark cherry and blackberry flavors, and warm vanilla and chocolate notes on the finish.

133170,133170,Spain,"The wines of Abelis Carthago are enigmatic. The lowest-priced Lui is the most balanced and complete. This wine, William, is dark and dense, with shoe polish and raw crude oil on the nose.

It lacks nuance and subtlety but will augment a good steak with nary a problem.",William Selection,90,34.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
133194,133194,Spain,"Caramel, molasses and spice aromas make this a totally approachable and familiar type of Sherry.

133198,133198,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's core strengths, which start with the bouquet's campfire and prune qualities and extend onto the palate, where peppy raspberry and plum flavors take over.

133199,133199,Spain,"Ripe, jammy and forward, Prima could become the blueprint for affordable but well-made Toro wines. It's a modern bruiser from a modern, spotless facility, and it offers a clash of wild berry flavors, big-time tannins and powerful acidity. Like most Toro wines, it'll take your cheeks to the cleaners if you don't have meaty foods, cheese or lots of water to go with it. Drink now through 2012.",Prima,90,18.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Maurodos
133210,133210,Spain,"Baked berry, earth and black tea aromas give this wine a solid opening, while the mouthfeel is gritty but honest.

133223,133223,Spain,"Purple in color, with extracted, rubbery, gaseous aromas that settle with time. More power than finesse here, with cheek-smacking, saturated fruit and a bit of spice.

133224,133224,Spain,"Best on the nose, where there's a mix of caramel, roasted fruit and lemon peel. The palate is big, sticky and tannic, with salty, semi herbal flavors of raspberry and leather.

133266,133266,Spain,"With some toast and popcorn to fatten up the standard apple aromas, this is a fairly rich cava, especially given the price.

133267,133267,Spain,"As under-$10 sparklers go, you'd be hard-pressed to find better than this medium-bodied and toasty version from Catalonia's White Castle.

But who's complaining?",Extra Brut,87,8.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
133280,133280,Spain,"A little bit sweet and doughy, but hardly offputting. Deep flavors of cherry, raspberry and strawberry control the palate, while the finish is chocolaty and long.

133293,133293,Spain,"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors.

The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper. Chewy, deep and ultimately dry on the finish. Drinkable now; best in another couple of years.",Gran Reserva,90,53.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
133358,133358,Spain,"Not a bad value in the Albariño category. Alba Rosa is the second wine from Martinez Serantes, and it's yellowish in color, with a pineapple and pear nose. Solid in the mouth, with touches of apple, white peach and lime. Proper acidity keeps it fresh.",Alba Rosa,85,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
133359,133359,Spain,"The nose has the vintage's heavy quality, yet the palate runs toward acidic, with an emphasis on red cherry and raspberry. The more it opens, and the more the wine's tannins and acids do their thing, the tougher it gets. Food seems like a must.",Crianza,85,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,12 Linajes
133360,133360,Spain,"Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas. But for anyone who likes fresh, pulpy juice, it tastes perfectly good.",Granbazán Ambar,85,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Agro de Bazán
133369,133369,Spain,"There's some stewed fruit weighing down this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon blend, but for the most part it has it going on. Coffee, oak and leather aromas set up a palate of raspberry, plum and chocolate. There's a fair amount of acid for an ‘03, and that lends legs to a wine that might otherwise seem tired.",,85,29.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vitis Terrarum
133379,133379,Spain,"Smooth on the nose, with vanilla and peach aromas. It's starting to fade but if you catch it soon you'll get apple, pineapple and some pithy character on both the palate and finish. Tastes wet and easy, and not at all complicated.",,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,White Blend,Inspiración Pampano
133381,133381,Spain,"Fairly stylish and true to the region; the nose is both meaty and leathery, with rustic but composed notes of roast plum, earth and oak.

133389,133389,Spain,"Plum, berry and other ripe fruits make for a solid, pure, attractive bouquet. The wine is fairly deep and plummy, with red raspberry raising the red-fruit quotient. Full and balanced, with modest complexity. Seems solid for a front-line '03.",Prestigio,88,26.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Emina
133474,133474,Spain,"Montsant's inherent character is nicely captured in this blend of Carignan, Syrah and Grenache. The bouquet is entirely smooth and inviting, if a bit generic. And the palate delivers ripe berry flavors that don't vary much from the fruity and basic. Call it simple or call it just right for the price; this is a fine red wine with character, balance and ease.",,89,16.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,Can Blau
133484,133484,Spain,"Tropical aromas mixed with pear are just right, and overall this Treixadura-Godello-Torrontes blend is ripe and delicious.

Drink now.",,89,19.0,Galicia,Ribeiro,,White Blend,Finca Teira
133492,133492,Spain,"Protos is a venerable RDD label that doesn't try to do too much with its wines. This youngster is tight, polished and deep, with rich, oily aromas and creamy, saturated blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. With spice and depth, it shows how good the 2005 vintage is, even for a big-production joven like this.",Roble,89,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Protos
133501,133501,Spain,"Rather hard and lightly grassy on the nose, with a green streak running through blueberry aromas.

Has qualities but doesn't fully click. 5,000 cases made.",Erial Tradicion Familia,87,45.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Epifanio Rivera
133518,133518,Spain,"Deep black fruit aromas make it inviting, while the palate is hefty and soft-edged, with creamy vanilla-infused plum and berry flavors.

Grows softer and more pedestrian the longer it airs out.",Carivin Reserve,87,19.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Tempranillo,Grandes Vinos y Viñedos
133565,133565,Spain,"Red fruit is the focus of this zesty, rugged Tempranillo-based wine. The palate is lively and acidic, as plum and berry flavors get lots of boost.

133566,133566,Spain,"Hay, corn and buttered toast are the initial aromas, and soon after the wine settles into a pretty good groove.

This wine handles its sugar like a pro.",Semi-Seco,87,10.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Castellblanch
133570,133570,Spain,"A wave of pleasant but light cherry, blackberry and sage offers a powerful but not overpowering opening.

133573,133573,Spain,"Warm and the slightest bit raisiny, but overall it's a bright, fruity blend of Monastrell and Tempranillo that's tasty and worth every dollar.

A treat for those who enjoy fruity, somewhat softer reds.",Crianza,87,12.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Santonegro
133603,133603,Spain,"An easygoing but nicely made Rioja that delivers purity, good fruit, body and feel. The nose is all cherry and berry, and it's a clear step up from your everyday red wine.

Lasting on the finish, with proper texture throughout.",Finca Vallobera,90,32.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Vallobera
133660,133660,Spain,"With its creamy oak and baked, stretched-out flavors, is it worth $110? You can decide, but the nose has that mildly cooked, heavy character that is reflective of 2003, and the palate is bland and drying as it mixes in oaky coconut and vanilla flavors. At one moment it's sharp and tangy; then it seems better. A confounding Tempranillo that doesn't excite.",Pago Negralada,84,110.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo,Abadia Retuerta
133664,133664,Spain,"Leathery and peanutty on the nose; soon the aromas expand to baked plum and stewy berries.

Finishes with bacon and leather accents.",Pecunia,84,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Campos Góticos
133666,133666,Spain,"Osborne can usually be counted on for consistency and traditional flavors. But this Amontillado is all over the map.

133667,133667,Spain,"Not every swing for the fences is rewarded with a home run. This wine, from a hot year, spent 22 months in oak. Thus it's a firebomb of dark, medicinal fruit mixed with root beer, lemon peel and creamy chocolate. Never does it really unfold or find a groove, and at times it's aggressive.",Parcela El Nogal,84,75.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Pago de los Capellanes
133675,133675,Spain,"At 70% Tempranillo and only 25% Cabernet and Merlot, there's a detectable green core running through the nose and palate.

133682,133682,Spain,"Dark fruit, tobacco and leathery spice make for a nice bouquet. Tight and forceful in the mouth, with ripe black fruit and firm tannins.

133705,133705,Spain,"Full and raring to go. This is one lively, big-boned red. It spreads out on the bouquet in peppery, boisterous fashion before unveiling lively raspberry and other red fruits on a bulky, tannic palate.

133706,133706,Spain,"Full and toasty, with roasted fruit, meat and leather on the ripe, robust bouquet. Blackberry and plum flavors are good, and the mouthfeel is manly if a bit tannic.

133707,133707,Spain,"Medium-strength plum and cherry aromas mix with earth and leather on a bouquet that's not all that fruity but still shows fruit.

133739,133739,Spain,"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too.

133741,133741,Spain,"You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.” It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose. That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity. This won't be for everyone.",Monte Toro Roble,89,17.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Ramon Ramos
133750,133750,Spain,"Rustic, smoky and deep on the nose, with a creamy body holding up commendable raspberry and plum flavors.

133752,133752,Spain,"Slightly rooty and warm, with a nose that's one part stewy and malty and another part complex and fruity.

133753,133753,Spain,"Very nice for a 2002. The wine is elegant and delivers aromas of violets, minerals and dried fruits. The palate folds in chocolate and spice along with a layer of blackberry flavor. We wouldn't call it superconcentrated or complex, but it's driven, pure and pleasurable.

133762,133762,Spain,"This Albariño grows on you right away. The wine starts out shy and clean, almost as if it were neutral.

133767,133767,Spain,"Ripe, tropical and laced with pineapple, nectarine, green banana and melon. This is the best Don Olegario we've had in the past three vintages, and that's because it's here in the year after harvest, as it should be.

133877,133877,Spain,"Lemon peel and zesty raspberry aromas greet you, and next in line comes a mouthful of sharp red-fruit flavors that are tangy and juicy.

133888,133888,Spain,"Very round and candied, with a ton of vanilla on the nose. It's made in the supersweet style, as if it's supposed to go with wedding cake or caramel bon bons. Yet there's enough balance to keep it on an even keel, which should make it perfect for those raised on candy-sweet wines and their kin.

133892,133892,Spain,"When in doubt, you can always trust Dry Sack. As always, this is a powerful, rich Sherry with burnt sugar and heavily toasted coffee and caramel flavors.

133963,133963,Spain,"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you.

133989,133989,Spain,"Nicely done, a touch soft, but strong as a whole.

134030,134030,Spain,"A mixture of baked fruit, bacon, asphalt and leather aromas is impressive, and so is the bright, composed palate and its flavors of plum, raspberry and tobacco.

134236,134236,Spain,Simple on the nose and like biting into a green apple when you taste it. There isn't much structure or grab to the wine; it's more like a wet wash of the mouth that finishes like ginger ale. An easy game to solve; drink now.,,83,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Orballo
134260,134260,Spain,"Dark in color. Cherry, raspberry and a touch of innertube rubber carry the nose toward a ripe palate featuring red apple and raspberry flavors. Finishes crisp and zesty, with nice acidity and commendable purity. Imported by Quality Wines of Spain.",Rosé,86,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
134262,134262,Spain,"Cherry cough drop, leather and moss aromas open it up, followed by red raspberry and some natural bitterness. Finishes with some gritty tannin and a slightly cooked, raisiny aftertaste. More of a throwback in style.",Reserva,86,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
134263,134263,Spain,"Light and moderately oaky, with dry, herbal accents to the red-fruit aromas that are dominant. Light cherry and strawberry are the key flavors, and they're backed by notes of toast, chocolate and leather. Classic and solid, especially for a down year.",Crianza,86,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
134273,134273,Spain,"Needs ample air to shake its early stewy, earthy character, and even then it recedes into a place best described as traditional. That means the nose is rustic, leathery and oaky, and the fruit is reserved, teetering toward drying and fading. A throwback with merits and demerits.",Gran Reserva,86,28.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Palacio
134275,134275,Spain,"Round and ripe, with a touch of rich prune and warm earth on the spice-cabinet nose. Fairly oaky, with coconut and raspberry flavors.

134281,134281,Spain,"The aromas are powerful and just the slightest bit brambly. A little hot and rugged on the palate, but loaded with prime black fruit, pepper and mocha notes. It's a potent wine with meaty blackness and plenty of raw power. With 65,000 cases produced, it's not a “boutique” wine, as evidenced by the friendly price tag.",Crianza,89,16.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Muruve
134345,134345,Spain,"Consistency is apparently not Fransola's calling card. One year it's pungent and green, and then in a warm year like 2006 it's fruity, ripe and sweet, with green apple, pear and tropical fruit flavors making their mark. Seems like Sauvignon Blanc in Catalonia needs ample heat to show the ginger, lime and apple characteristics that make it a likable. In this case, that's mostly what's on display.",Fransola,88,29.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Sauvignon Blanc,Torres
134349,134349,Spain,"Crushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.",Volvoreta Probus,88,25.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Nuntia Vini
134353,134353,Spain,"The essence of 2005 is captured in this creamy, rich offering that touches up against overripe but pulls back into balance at the last moment.

134356,134356,Spain,"A solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish.

134357,134357,Spain,"Abelis Carthago's top wine, Fighting Bulls, is also its toughest to enjoy. There's overripeness and barnyard on the nose, and thus the prune, black plum and jammy berry flavors that control the palate are not surprising. Big and forceful for sure, but also choppy and incongruent across the palate.",Fighting Bulls,88,60.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Abelis Carthago
134358,134358,Spain,"Ripe and honeyed, but also nicely balanced by flower blossom aromas and acidic zest on the palate. For straightforward apricot and peach flavors, this wine serves its purpose.

134363,134363,Spain,"Early aromas of wintergreen, pepper and autumn leaves are joined by plum and cherry sweetness on the palate.

Should drink well for the next four or five years.",Selección de Familia,88,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
134367,134367,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's raisiny ripeness; it's confirmed via Sherry/Port aromas and black plum/baked fruit flavors. But it's not simply a heavyweight on its last legs. To the contrary, the wine delivers a jolt of core intensity and finishing notes of spicy black pepper and licorice. Drink right away.",Reserva,88,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
134397,134397,Spain,"Gaseous, earthy, mossy aromas are not entirely inviting, and the palate is immensely thick and round, with big, grating tannins.

An extracted wine with minor balance and aromatic issues.",Gotín del Risc,86,17.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Abad
134399,134399,Spain,"Banana, lemon curd and sawdust are the prime aromas on this oaky, creamy, candied style of Chard from Navarra.

134407,134407,Spain,"Another winner from Emilio Moro. The nose is a touch minty and very spicy, but the black fruit element is there and overall the bouquet sings of integration.

134439,134439,Spain,"Red fruit, hints of spice and a touch of herbal essence kick it off. The palate is leafy and drying, with medium-ripe cherry and berry flavors.

134440,134440,Spain,"Heavy, with a lot of oak, which is reflected in both the amber color and the aromas. Flavors of vanilla, lemon drop, banana and wood resin take a moment or two to get used to, but they grow on you. Not a lot of complexity or breadth, but interesting for what it is.",Conde de Valdemar Blanco,85,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Bodegas Valdemar
134441,134441,Spain,"Attractive on the nose, with violet, cherry and a bit of candy. Round and satisfying in the mouth, with full berry flavors and mouthcoating tannins.

134446,134446,Spain,"A touch minty and rustic, but with enough black cherry, marmalade and tannin to make the grade. Jammy, medium in density and solid. A stout, friendly red made for early drinking.",,85,10.0,Central Spain,Madrid,,Tempranillo,Merum
134450,134450,Spain,"Warm and earthy, with a round, ripe nose. The palate is a touch on the sweet, cooked side, but it avoids being stewy or soupy and instead shows ripe black fruit, licorice and smoked meat. Quite soft and low in acid.

134524,134524,Spain,"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Fino Light,83,15.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Harveys
134541,134541,Spain,"Cola, cherry and mint aromas give reason for optimisim, but the palate is extraordinarily hard and acidic.

134550,134550,Spain,"Violet and blackberry aromas are an inviting first act, while the palate is lush and fairly deep, with thick blackberry and mildly brambly flavors.

134552,134552,Spain,"Dark plum aromas are sweetened and softened by oak-based coconut aromas, while the color and weight are deeper and darker than average.

134558,134558,Spain,"Not much different than the basic Sarria rosado, with maybe a touch more concentration and richness. The nose is a bit dusty, with good berry fruit notes and a whiff of cherry blossom. The palate is wet and fresh, with raspberry and plum-skin flavors. Crisp and refreshing.",Viñedo N° 5 Rosé,88,14.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Señorío de Sarria
134613,134613,Spain,"Forward and a touch racy, with moderate sweetness on the bouquet. Runs juicy and tight, with fresh, almost tart raspberry and cherry flavors. Offers the basics and not much more, but it's a balanced wine made in the traditional style, meaning it's dry, acidic and medium-bodied.",Viña Real Crianza,86,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,CVNE
134619,134619,Spain,"Traditional in the way it displays molasses, tobacco and cherry cola among its aromatics. Satisfying in the mouth, with lightweight cherry supported by oak-driven vanilla.

134633,134633,Spain,"Here's a wine that rides heavy with smoked meat and cured ham aromas.

Short on the finish, with a touch of vanilla.",Primum Vitae Reserva,86,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Vallformosa
134643,134643,Spain,"A bigger wine at 14.5%, this offers the full allotment of leather, crude oil, violet petals and cassis.

134653,134653,Spain,"The importance of a great vintage is evident in this crianza holdover from the lauded 2001 harvest.

134658,134658,Spain,"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth.

134659,134659,Spain,"Dark and sultry on the nose, with aromas of burnt toast and raisin that hint at ripeness and some serious oak aging.

134665,134665,Spain,"Quite ripe for a traditional crianza. The bouquet starts out on the stewy side but soon sheds its weight to reveal flavors of blackberry, black cherry and earth.

134672,134672,Spain,"A good taste of Toro at the right price. The nose deals classic baked fruit, rubber and girth, while the warm, full palate shows reasonable vitality along with berry and cassis flavors. Solid and a little chocolaty on the finish. A textbook warm-climate Spanish wine.",Auroch,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Tribal
134691,134691,Spain,"Perfectly drinkable Monastrell year after year despite the silly name. Plum and roasted berry aromas and flavors are sweet, ripe, clean and on the generic side of the fence.

134704,134704,Spain,"For the most part this is a full-bodied, full-fruited wine that has what it takes to win people over.

134710,134710,Spain,"This is a good table wine with sweet, woodsy aromas of sandalwood, clove, cinnamon and earth. The palate turns a bit to the tangy, sharp side.

134714,134714,Spain,"Smells a touch green and pasty, and while the wine is deep and dark, there isn't a whole lot of definition or specificity to it.

134716,134716,Spain,"Round in style, with soft white-fruit and apple blossom aromas. Tastes a touch reduced, as if the lemon, lime and melon flavors had been condensed and amplified.

134720,134720,Spain,"Fairly big and muscular, with black fruit, cinnamon and olive notes on the nose. The palate is beefy and deep, with plum and blackberry flavors. With big tannins and a full-bodied personality, this is not a lightweight.",,85,10.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Merlot,Finca Antigua
134722,134722,Spain,"Some early pickle and sauerkraut aromas were worrisome until they completely disappeared. Left in their wake are flavors of apple juice and peaches, while the mouthfeel registers as solid and full. A little funky and definitely not for everyone, given the wine's overt sweetness and oddities.",Carta Nevada Semi Dry,85,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
134723,134723,Spain,"Not a complete swing and a miss, but nothing special despite the miniscule production and higher-than-normal price. The color is pale and the nose has some gaps.

134735,134735,Spain,"It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits.

134748,134748,Spain,"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors.

135034,135034,Spain,"For years this wine was a big-time bargain from Navarra. Now it's not so inexpensive yet the quality is the same. There's common nectarine and raspberry aromas before snappy peach and berry flavors. It's juicy and modest, with crispness and a drying finish.",Gran Feudo Rosé,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Garnacha,Bodegas Julián Chivite
135035,135035,Spain,"Light and modest in aromas, although scents of citrus blossom and nectarine manage to work their way to the top of the bouquet. The palate is smooth and creamy, with flavors of red plum, melon and chocolate. A good wine that won't make you go crazy looking for complexities and depth.",Rosado,85,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Bohigas
135039,135039,Spain,"Plump and full of plum and licorice aromas. Weighs in big and a touch sweet, with black cherry and ripe plum flavors. Very soft in the feel department, with a soft finish that's like a cushioned fall. Healthy as a whole, with lively tannins.",Old Vines,85,16.0,Spain Other,Spain,,Grenache-Syrah,Merum
135042,135042,Spain,"This full-bodied, cherry-dominated Garnacha is pretty good considering the price. The nose is a bit raisiny and ripe, while the palate is sweet but balanced. A standard red wine with clarity and no surprises.",,84,6.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
135052,135052,Spain,"This Monastrell-based rosado is indicative of the Jumilla region, meaning it's sweet, a bit heavy, and fairly candied in its aromas. Flavors of fleshy raspberry and strawberry are full, while the round finish is neutral. Low in acid; drink right away.",Rosado,84,10.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Rosé,Alceño
135056,135056,Spain,"Sweet and floral, like light berries with crushed flower petals. The palate is not as comforting; it's acidic and bouncy, which fosters good flavors but a jagged, jumpy mouthfeel. You want to like this wine but the feel doesn't make it easy.",Reserva,84,11.0,Central Spain,Valdepeñas,,Tempranillo,Laguna de la Nava
135059,135059,Spain,"Pretty good for a $6 sparkler, even if the nose has a whiff of rubber band and wet clay to go along with light citrus and cherry aromas. The palate is fruity and carbonated, so you get spritz with your cherry, strawberry and tangerine flavors. Good for sparkling Sangria as well as casual sipping.",Mediterranean Pétillant,84,6.0,Catalonia,Catalonia,,Rosé,René Barbier
135064,135064,Spain,"Earthy and crusty at first, with smoked meat, black fruit and dryness to the nose. The palate is well formed and proper, with dry raspberry and mild chocolate flavors.

135081,135081,Spain,"A super sweet, potent brew that takes no prisoners as it hits with powerful toffee, caramel and alcohol aromas. Good in the mouth because it's not gritty, but very sweet on the palate, with honey, brown sugar and cinnamon flavors. If sweet is your thing, then add a point or two to our score.",Esnobista Moscatel Pasa,88,20.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
135087,135087,Spain,"Having really liked this wine a couple of years ago, this vintage seems comparatively fierce and aggressive, which isn't to say it isn't hugely flavorful and aromatic. On the down side, it's residue-heavy and tannic, with full extraction and tannic berry fruit. Tough as nails; maybe it just needs a couple of years to settle.",,88,90.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Paixar
135088,135088,Spain,"Opens with rich aromas of raisin, licorice, black plum and molasses that put it on the cusp of overripe. The palate is rich and gritty, with deep berry and molasses flavors. Generous for sure, but also slightly baked and sweet. Tastes like a warm-climate, warm-vintage wine. Drink now.",La Montesa,88,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Palacios Remondo
135089,135089,Spain,"Raspberry and plum aromas carry a mild floral, perfumed accent, while the palate is medium in weight, with good flow due to lively acidity.

135153,135153,Spain,"A touch timid in how it doles out slight raspberry and light oak aromas. And that's in front of a mellow, quiet palate that offers basic berry flavors and not much more. Far from the most cushioned, lush wine going; it hits firmly and evenly, like a welterweight from a past era.",Reserva,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
135155,135155,Spain,"Basic, fresh and fruity, with floral aromas that capture the essence of clean, tank-made Viura.

135158,135158,Spain,"Once again this Viura ranks as one of the better values in white Rioja. It deals a punchbowl bouquet of round melon and pineapple, while the dry but fresh palate pushes green melon and white pepper. Limited in what it can offer but good for what it costs.",,85,7.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Marqués de Cáceres
135162,135162,Spain,"Encouraging aromas of earth, leather, plum and berry lead to a rather sheer, zesty palate of blackberry, cherry and acid. It's tight in the mouth, with cheeky tannins and friction. Quite extracted and oaky; requires food or will seem astringent.",,85,25.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Red Blend,Tarsus
135171,135171,Spain,"For years Ysios has been one of Spain's most architecturally astounding wineries, but its wines have lagged. This is not a new wine, so it falls into that simple, basic category. It's aging decently, showing citrus, root beer and tobacco. Good but midland.",Reserva,85,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Ysios
135176,135176,Spain,"A sniff delivers aromas of dried fruits along with a smack of toast and char. Runs light to medium across the palate, with cranberry and raspberry rising as the primary flavors.

135219,135219,Spain,"In general O. Fournier gets it right, be it in Spain or Argentina. But this Ribera del Duero struggles from the outset. It's rubbery, damp and lacks clarity of fruit. And the feel is sharp and lemony, seemingly a combo of excessive oak and raw fruit. Imported by Fine Wines from Spain.",Spiga,80,29.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,O. Fournier
135244,135244,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet.

135253,135253,Spain,"Just a bit mulchy on the nose, which signals that is a wine from the hot 2003 vintage. The palate sits on raisin and mocha, and there's even a creamy, thick feel to it. If you like rich, Porty flavors that border on dessert, it's likable. But be prepared for it to hit with a thud.",Reserva,87,49.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Alidis
135257,135257,Spain,"Inky dark, with deep berry, sandalwood and sawmill aromas. Color and potency are not lacking in this modern-styled Tempranillo, which hits like a hammer.

Now it's very tight and tannic, with piercing acidity.",MC,87,46.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de Cáceres
135265,135265,Spain,"Castilla y León can be good bargain country, and all of the 2006 Volteo wines are Best Buy qualifiers.

135304,135304,Spain,"Seems like the brutal heat of 2003 got to this wine in a negative way. The result is a thick, unctuous, syrupy wine with a ton of sweetness but not much balance. The alcohol is listed at 15.5%, and it seems bigger. Very much a heavyweight, and with no agility.",El Albar Excelencia,84,40.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,J. & F. Lurton
135311,135311,Spain,"Apple and peach define the bouquet, but where's the pop? This cava seems a touch quiet and reticent. It's drying, with flavors of apple, white corn and soda cracker.

135347,135347,Spain,"Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more.

135365,135365,Spain,"Radiator dust, baked apple and other familiar, semirich aromas grace the nose on this more elevated Cava.

135376,135376,Spain,"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit.

Drink now through 2012.",Selección Crianza,88,18.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fuentespina
135420,135420,Spain,"Opens with exotic, earthy aromas and lots of black fruit, but it turns more quiet and timid with airing.

135427,135427,Spain,"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors.

135480,135480,Spain,"For an affordable Priorat this wine isn't disappointing. The nose is a bit funky and gamy, but you'll also dig out mineral, leather and bacon notes that are pleasing. Peppery and spicy more than lush and fruity, with pushy game and herbal notes on the finish.",Crianza Dara,85,14.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
135482,135482,Spain,"An organic wine with brushy aromas of tobacco, bramble and berry. Fairly true and full in the mouth, with a note of raisin to the black cherry and plum flavors. Gets better with time but always seems a bit grassy.",Crianza Organic,85,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Mutuo
135483,135483,Spain,"A zealous wine with sweaty leather, prune and leftover oak on the nose. The mouth is charged up and lively as the tannins and acids meet to boost cherry and raspberry fruit.

135484,135484,Spain,"Murkier than ideal. The nose is heavy and earthy, and it's full of barnyard initially.

135485,135485,Spain,"This wine kind of misses the mark. The nose is a bit stewy and less than pure, while the palate seems tight, grabby and herbal.

135489,135489,Spain,"Rusty in color, which is to be expected. The nose shows dried cherry, belt leather and cigar box, and at this point all seems dandy.

Already past its prime.",Gran Reserva,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
135495,135495,Spain,"Light salmon in color, with fruity, relaxed raspberry aromas.

135548,135548,Spain,"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish.

135558,135558,Spain,"This is Cáceres' bread-and-butter red Rioja, and the '04 is fruity, light and very approachable.

135559,135559,Spain,"Superripe, such that it's medicinal and pruny. The nose reeks of reduced blueberry and cassis, while the palate is soft, low in acidity and full of ripe, dark raisin, prune and spice cake flavors. If you like a dense wine, this is it.

135578,135578,Spain,"Floral, sweet and not the least bit complicated or strained. This is easygoing red wine for easy times. It's a bit candied and baked, but that's Garnacha from Central Spain.

135605,135605,Spain,"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate.

135609,135609,Spain,"Jammy and full of raisin, stewed berries and leather. Calling it ultraripe might be an understatement because it's nearly over the top in its heft, extract and tannin level.

135612,135612,Spain,"Hits with force as well as notes of raisin and Sherry. No doubt this comes from a hot vintage, evidenced by the prune, brandied cherry and chocolate flavors.

135819,135819,Spain,"Grapy and granular smelling, with heavy, raw aromas that lack finesse and agility but offer plenty of thump. Surprisingly, the palate on this dark, more modern-styled wine is kind of tart, with racy cherry and blackberry fruit. Not an easy wine to evaluate; you want more from it but it isn't that generous.",Reserva Selección,84,135.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Lealtanza
135820,135820,Spain,"Typically dry and leathery, with only modest red-fruit aromas. It's light to medium in weight, with punchy acidity pushing clean but thin cherry and plum fruit.

135826,135826,Spain,"Light in color; almost transparent. The nose is largely as the color suggests: light and leathery, with old-school character.

135828,135828,Spain,"Starts with lightly roasted aromas of herbal fruit and pepper, while the palate is deeper and more pure, with raspberry, cherry and cranberry flavors.

135829,135829,Spain,"Smells like slow-roasted fruit mixed with a dusting of savory spice. Not the freshest kid on the block, but it offers cherry and apple-skin flavors that are decent and smooth. Not a thriller but not bad.",,84,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Jarrero
135830,135830,Spain,"Funky, with earthy, heavy aromas. Seems a bit rubbery and peppery, with cola, plum and olive flavors. Tannic, too. Not nearly as fruity, clean, ripe and pleasing as the 2001.",Prestigio,84,23.0,Northern Spain,Cigales,,Tinta Fina,Val de Los Frailes
135831,135831,Spain,"Traditionally leathery, with earth and bramble on the bouquet.

135924,135924,Spain,"Far more lean, raw and rough than ideal, with a touch of burnt field on the nose. The palate keeps that raw, reedy taste, which is smoothed out by softening oak notes.

136306,136306,Spain,"Char and chocolate, then a dollop of rum raisin and black cherry, and there is your nose. This version of Cirsion, one of our very favorite modern Riojas, is relatively soft, raisiny and simple, and for that it doesn't quite rate with some of the past vintages, which were spectacular. But that doesn't mean you won't love the wine's smooth texture, cocoa and baked berry flavors, and its overall generous character. Drink now through 2010.",Cirsion,92,273.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
136308,136308,Spain,"Right away this shows the requisite signs of excellence. The meaty, earthy, leathery, full-fruit nose is just right, and the palate is elevated in how it is infused with pure blackberry and plum as well as chocolate and fine herbs.

136309,136309,Spain,"Like all young Sierra Cantabria wines made from old vines, this has a purple color that's supported by aromas of coffee, mocha and black fruits. It's half aged in American oak (the other half is French), and it's much more tannic, acidic and structured than the fleshy 2003. A wine with pure flavors and a dynamic structure.

136314,136314,Spain,"Benjamin Romeo makes nothing but big, idiosyncratic wines. And some are big hits while others may not be your thing. This modern, round, polished blend is creamy and smooth but also loaded with almond, pear, citrus and toast flavors. Certainly there's a strong wood element, but it handles it with aplomb and oozes class. Drink as soon as possible. It won't age much past 2007. Only 25 cases made.",Qué Bonito Cacareaba,92,74.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Benjamin Romeo
136318,136318,Spain,"Robust and sexy, with smoke, leather and pure berry and plum aromas that make for a sensational bouquet. The palate is up to the precedent set by the nose, as the cherry and cola flavors are outright lovely. For what you get, this is almost a value. It shows us what that Muga can do in a great vintage.",Selección Especial Reserva,92,37.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
136319,136319,Spain,"Stylish and serious, with polished, fancy oak sitting like royalty atop dark   fruit that is almost pruney.

Not quite at the level of the classic 2001 but still excellent.",El Puntido,92,54.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
136361,136361,Spain,"Berry, earth and a touch of citrus peel make for a good bouquet, while the palate shows structure and lots of verve.

136363,136363,Spain,"Clean, fresh and layered up front, with peach, cherry and nectarine flavors and then apricot on the finish. The feel is good throughout, with no excess weight or sweetness.

136366,136366,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now.

136414,136414,Spain,"Quite rooty and earthy, with brandied cherry aromas. Not too pure and fruity, as green bean and carob creep onto the palate. Finishes a touch dry and tannic. Seems caught in Neverland.",Gran Reserva,83,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,LAN
136416,136416,Spain,"Olive, roast plum and heavy berry aromas lead toward modest boysenberry flavors that show some weediness.

136420,136420,Spain,"Quite brambly, with a persistent burnt character that sticks with it from start to finish. Along the way there's cooked cherry and raspberry flavors supported by strong oak notes. Fails to improve in the glass; in fact it's just the opposite, as it falls apart.",Crianza,83,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Solar de Randez

136422,136422,Spain,"Rubbery yet light-bodied, with distant berry and burnt-wood aromas. Seems dilute and more acidic than ideal, with crisp fruit flavors that run tart and zippy.

136434,136434,Spain,"Pickled aromas are obvious on the chunky, warm bouquet, and never does the wine shed its green personality.

136437,136437,Spain,"Saucy, with overt oak aromas that manifest themselves as espresso and charred beef. Fairly acidic and thin across the palate, where pie cherry is the dominant flavor and sourness mars the finish.",Reserva,82,68.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza
136443,136443,Spain,"Solid as can be, with sweet-styled aromas of berry syrup and tire rubber. In the mouth, the wine shows juicy cherry and raspberry flavors in front of a lively finish.

136449,136449,Spain,"It's hard to rate an aging, oxidizing, barrel-fermented Verdejo and take into consideration the wine's faded qualities versus its complexities. If you like dried apricots, dehydrated mango slices and fruit jellies, then this will tickle your fancy.

136456,136456,Spain,"This tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors.

136457,136457,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character.

136461,136461,Spain,"Starts out sharp and funky, and then quickly you realize that it's showing signs of age. The wine blends sweet and sour notes on both the bouquet and palate, issuing primary grapefruit flavors and some mustard greens on the finish. But the feel is chunky and it's losing its zest day by the day.",,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Vega de la Reina
136476,136476,Spain,"Opens with decent dusty apple and peach aromas, but they don't really hold together for long.

Drink right away; it won't age well.",Blanco,84,9.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Sauvignon Blanc,Basico
136477,136477,Spain,"More soft and milky than exact or pungent, with bitterness intermixed with apple on the palate. Feels a little soft and bland for such a young Rueda white. Perfectly drinkable but uninspired.",,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Analivia
136486,136486,Spain,"Pithy, heavy and chunky, with waxy fruit mixed with oak.

Decent for a barrel fermented Viura but nothing to write home about.",Barrel Fermented White,84,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,White Blend,Marqués de Cáceres
136489,136489,Spain,"Raisiny and baked on the nose, with a syrupy consistency to the palate. Along the way there's stewed fruit, baked blackberry pie notes and overt sweetness.

136501,136501,Spain,"Lean and peppery, with more citrus than berry on the nose. The mouth is a bit grabby, with a starchy feel and far-reaching tannins. Clearly not a great wine but it holds itself together.",3 Months in Oak,81,6.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo,Casa Solar
136505,136505,Spain,"Hard and jumbled up front, with slightly harsh peppery notes interlocking with light raspberry fruit. A light, airy, almost innocuous wine with mild bitterness on the finish. Doesn't impress.",,81,8.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Rioja Vega
136506,136506,Spain,"A blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Grenache that can only be described as strange. The nose is stewy, the palate full of root beer, baked berries and syrup.

136530,136530,Spain,"Deep and dark on the nose, with licorice, cola and prune aromas. The palate is chunky and full, albeit a touch soft.

136532,136532,Spain,"Opens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place.

136553,136553,Spain,"Dark and dense, with aromas of rich black fruits, grilled meat and a lot of oak. The palate is extracted but it's not the least bit hard or biting.

136583,136583,Spain,"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity.

136584,136584,Spain,"Dark purple in color, with a jammy nose of berry fruit and coconut.

136587,136587,Spain,"Comes across a bit baked, syrupy and sweet on the nose, with a hint of stalkiness and stem. The palate has a lush early feel, but further inspection unveils a hollow core.

136616,136616,Spain,"It has taken this bodega a few years to get it right, but in 2004 this blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet is dark and rocking.

136666,136666,Spain,"Cuatro implies four grapes blended together, and the nose on this Tempranillo/Cab/Merlot/Syrah mix is a bit leathery and tight.

136722,136722,Spain,"Smells fairly solid, with plum, prune and leather. But the palate is ultrasweet and milky, with a strong candied essence that doesn't impress unless your thing is chocolate-covered cherries and vanilla. Way too expensive for what's in the bottle.",Fagus,82,37.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Garnacha,Coto de Hayas
136723,136723,Spain,"Heavy and green, with nutty, leathery aromas. Rather candied and less than fresh in the mouth, with a weedy underbelly on the palate.

136728,136728,Spain,"There's a lot of raw power on this jumbled red that starts with rubber and spice before settling on maple. The mouth is a cacaphony of loud flavors, while the finish is stark.

136734,136734,Spain,"A raisiny wine of the first order. The nose is stewed, while the pruny palate is soft and chocolaty, mostly because there's no detectable acidity.

136753,136753,Spain,"A little baked and flat smelling, with licorice and stewed fruit aromas. Sounds kind of dark and heavy, right?

136755,136755,Spain,"Magenta-tinted and ready to go; that in a nutshell is this easy, no-oak blend of Tempranillo and Grenache.

136760,136760,Spain,"The winery has dialed back the time in oak for its barrel-fermented Viura to two months from five or six, and it's a decidedly less oaky wine than in years prior.

136897,136897,Spain,"You're going to like this masculine, well-oaked blend of 80% Tempranillo with 10% each Graciano and Garnacha. It's got modern touches but a lot of tradition as well. The wine is rich and round, with tobacco, coffee, chocolate and earth creating depth and character.

136901,136901,Spain,"This seems eminently ageworthy; it has the strong foundation and pulsing acidity required of a true cellar dweller. The raspberry and plum fruit have a beam of acidity and the tannins are not shy. Shows all the hallmarks of a fine modern Rioja: power, purity and balance.

136907,136907,Spain,"A dense wine from the start, and each subsequent whiff of the oaky but vital nose is convincing.

137010,137010,Spain,"Oddly aromatized, with strong hints of hickory and sweets. The whole wine is a strange mix of clove and distant fruit. Finishes with weird notes of spiced tea and rubber.

137041,137041,Spain,"Interesting and unique blends get bonus points, but in the long run this conglomeration of indigenous grapes from Mallorca is a touch too resiny and bland to really deserve a call out.

137044,137044,Spain,"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive.

137191,137191,Spain,"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors.

137273,137273,Spain,"A solid, earthy style of Navarran red wine, with plum, berry and meaty aromas. The palate is forward, with solid flavors of tobacco, plum, tomato and leather.

137347,137347,Spain,"White raisin and touches of lettuce and celery give this multigrape blend some richness but also a bit of green character.

137448,137448,Spain,"Dark, sweet and candied on the nose, with hints of raisin and licorice that become more prominent in the mouth.

137607,137607,Spain,"Look for the wine wrapped in banana-yellow paper, and you'll likely be surprised and pleased by its ripe, clean aromas and easygoing plum and cherry flavors.

137673,137673,Spain,"A bit too much new American oak was thrown at this crianza, leaving minty, drying aromas that veer into the butter and dill range.

This is a classic modern-styled wine with intense roasted berry, herb and exotic spice flavors. Licorine, prune, coffee and oak emerge on the broad finish. Very ripe yet it does a good job of straddling the line between big and overripe.",,89,16.0,Central Spain,Almansa,,Red Blend,Atalaya
138150,138150,Spain,"Starts out sort of jumbled, with heavy aromas, deep fruit scents and a shot of leather or animal hide. The palate is healthy, however, with proper acidity pushing earthy plum and berry flavors. Shows good structure and ample size and mouthfeel. The blend is 75% Garnacha and 25% Graciano.",Sur,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Inurrieta
138240,138240,Spain,"Quite brambly and funky, with a roasted “country” quality that points it toward leather and rubber. An organic wine with 80% Tempranillo and 20% Garnacha; it's sort of tangy and choppy on the palate, with a mix of awkwardly sweet and sour flavors.",Organic,83,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Greener Planet
138246,138246,Spain,"Concentrated aromas of mocha, toffee and burnt coffee bound from the glass, followed by flavors of sour red cherry and berry.

138254,138254,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",,83,28.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Mar de Frades
138275,138275,Spain,"For a good price you get a lot of white wine here. Muga barrel ferments this Viura, so there's popcorn and richness to the nose, but it's not overwhelming.

Pour a glass of this with your next platter of sizzling garlic shrimp and you'll be in heaven.",,89,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Viura,Muga
138281,138281,Spain,"Good color and intriguing aromas of baked fruit, tobacco and mint indicate that you're getting some modern-styled ripeness along with traditional Rioja earth, spice and old man's library.

138298,138298,Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",Colección Jaime Rodríguez,89,104.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
138299,138299,Spain,"Bramble bush, graphite, leather and medium-depth fruit are the opening notes on this qualm-free, fairly muscular Rioja.

138457,138457,Spain,"Two vintages running this is good, even-flowing rosé. The color is on the red side, but the nose dials in on fluffy red-berry aromas.

138463,138463,Spain,"Initially it smells a bit cheesy and drawn, but with time it evolves to show plum, raspberry and tire rubber aromas. In the mouth, it's tight, fresh and a little gritty, with red-fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Not overly generous in terms of mouthfeel, but it does push the fruit until the final bell. More of a food wine than a solo sipper.",Reserva,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo Blend,Malumbres
138466,138466,Spain,"Opens with marshmallow-like sweetness on the nose, but that changes to lean fruit and saline with time.

Well done but nothing unusual.",Reserva,86,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Montecillo
138468,138468,Spain,"Ochoa usually puts out a good rosado made from Garnacha, and this vintage keeps the winery's reputation intact.

138476,138476,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish.

138560,138560,Spain,"Waxy and burning on the nose, and then very heavy and sugary on the palate.

138592,138592,Spain,"Black cherry and toasty oak aromas greet you, followed by racy raspberry flavors. There's a lot of acid, but there's also ample berry flesh and texture to handle it.

138843,138843,Spain,"Raw and resiny, with no peg for you to hang your hat on. The palate is sharp and short on ripeness, while the finish settles on hot. Just an aggressive wine with little polish. Not worth the price.",Javier Asensio,82,29.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Merlot,Asensio
138857,138857,Spain,"Green, lemony and murky on the nose, this young wine shows that a good vintage in a renowned region doesn't always amount to a good wine.

138865,138865,Spain,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",,80,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Eleusis
138898,138898,Spain,"A little bit leafy and light, but that's traditional Rioja for you. The color is a mix of orange and red, while the palate of snappy red fruits is beginning to slip toward peach and nectarine. If you like a leaner, racier style of wine, then drink this now. It's probably at its peak.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,88,30.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
139179,139179,Spain,"Fans of big, blocky reds that offer punch, extract and tannins should jump on this now, and then watch it age nicely for the next four or five years. That's the type of meaty, tannic, fruit-infused Tempranillo this is.

139186,139186,Spain,"A heavier, more elevated style, but still well-priced relative to the competition.

139475,139475,Spain,"Bouquet is nice and smooth, with an earthy warmth surrounding scents of purple flowers and crushed berries.

139476,139476,Spain,"Alert and snappy on the nose, with no “hot” or stewy characteristics from the steamy year.

A solid wine from a hellishly warm vintage.",Roda Reserva,88,48.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Roda
139478,139478,Spain,"Stout and generally quite pure, with aromas of leather and berries that thicken and gather density with airing.

139495,139495,Spain,"Plenty of dusty, spicy aromas run the nose, almost to the exclusion of ripe fruit. But once it opens the wine displays savory flavors as well as some pure dark berry.

Somewhat acidic and sheer, so better with food; drink now.",Crianza,87,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Marqués de la Concordia
139497,139497,Spain,"A juicy, prickly wine with pungent red-fruit aromas backed by tangy cherry, raspberry and currant flavors.

139782,139782,Spain,"A little tight and reticent, but airing reveals aromas of raisin, marzipan and earth.

140089,140089,Spain,"A good effort in a tough year, and frankly we're happy that Muga decided to make a reserva in 2002. The wine shows lean aromas of dried red fruit, tomato leaf and dill.

Good but leaner than a normal Muga effort.",Reserve,87,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Muga
140090,140090,Spain,"Early aromas of leather, rubber and char sort of shadow the fruit component. But in the mouth there's ample blackberry, cherry and pepper, all of which bring the wine into form.

140744,140744,Spain,"Quite yellow, with toffee, peanuts and light fruit aromas. Big and round in the mouth, with dried apple, almond and white pepper flavors.

140791,140791,Spain,"The definition of old-vines Priorato can be found within this bottle. The Garnacha is very old, the Cariñena even older, and some mature Cabernet Sauvignon adds spine. On the nose, there's a lot of barrique. The palate is snappy, almost acidic, and thus the flavors run toward pie cherry and raspberry. Classic in style; an Old World throwback.

140792,140792,Spain,"Big and ripe, with tobacco, blackberry and fresh-cut lumber on the nose.

140799,140799,Spain,"Intense and colorful; one of the most flavorful and sizable versions of Terrasses on record. Flavors of boysenberry, blackberry and plum sizzle, while the layered palate spreads out nicely upon airing. Everything about this Cariñena-dominated wine is solid and precise.

140805,140805,Spain,"Pure and cerebral, but with enough natural liveliness that you can't help but love it. Aromas of schist, lavender and plum mix with oak-driven bacon and chocolate to create a welcoming whole. Sizable cherry and plum flavors are round but also precise and firm. Looming tannins suggest some cellaring may be warranted. The blend is Garnacha followed by Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon.

140815,140815,Spain,"Like a freight train, this wine from the village of Poboleda hits with force. From Joan Doix and his winemaking nephew, Ramón Llagostera, it deftly delivers both red and black fruit notes, all on a lightly tannic frame. To call it lip-smacking and juicy would be correct.

140816,140816,Spain,"Ripe and rich; it pushes the limit toward raisiny but doesn't cross the boundary. As a result, the sweet bouquet oozes kirsch, licorice and spice.

140870,140870,Spain,"With raisiny, damp aromas and a flat body, we can only label this Marqués de Murrieta high-ender a miss. While not a disaster, you'd expect more from something labeled Gran Reserva Especial, but instead it fails to capture the essence of Rioja and shows heavy cola, blackberry and truffle flavors as well as deep, dull tannins.

141066,141066,Spain,"Pure Garnacha, which is anathema in the region. Savory on the nose, with roasted meat and spice notes as much as fruit.

141076,141076,Spain,"A millennium wine that's now in fine form. It's a typical Garnacha-Cariñena blend that runs heavy on Garnacha.

141170,141170,Spain,"Varietal Graciano is something we frequently see, and very rarely does it bowl us over.

141275,141275,Spain,"A throwback Rioja that sports tobacco, mulch and some true Old-World aromas that make you question the wine's health. But airing breathes life and tilts it toward dried cherries.

141283,141283,Spain,"As always, this gracious white wine made from the Viura grape delivers the goods.

141299,141299,Spain,"For unafflicted plum and berry character, this young, fresh Rioja has the goods.

141571,141571,Spain,"Fine aromas that announce balance and completeness draw you in, and right away you will like the cherry, red currant and cassis flavors.

141574,141574,Spain,"As per usual, this wine carries a leafiness and peppery quality that runs ahead of its fruit quotient.

141593,141593,Spain,"Aromas of cherry sucking candy, sangria and citrus peel are easy and clean but not what you'd call sophisticated.

141598,141598,Spain,"Seems like Solabal let its reserva-level grapes get a little too soft before picking. The wine has color and potential, but the nose is a little flat and syrupy.

141986,141986,Spain,"Seductively rich, with blackberry and vanilla aromas. Ripe and chewy, with plum, vanilla and subtle spice in the background.

141988,141988,Spain,"A bit transparent in color, but only by Priorat standards. The nose, however, offers all the crusty, earthy red fruit you'd expect; it leads nicely into a palate of sweet cherry, plum and vanilla. Big enough on the finish, with mouthfeel galore. The full package from the town of La Vilella Alta, and not too tannic. Imported by Winebow.",Montgarnatx,88,45.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Garnacha,Francesc Sanchez Bas
142006,142006,Spain,"Mature but not even close to expiring, with cola, root beer, tree bark and leather on the bouquet. Fairly acidic, which is why it has so much verve at 10+ years. Flavors of dried cherry, raspberry and citrus peel are classic in their attack. Very good in an Old World way. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",Faustino de Autor Reserva Especial,88,50.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
142008,142008,Spain,"Cherry, earth and leather are nice opening notes, while some charred oak adds masculinity and depth.

142013,142013,Spain,"Clean, nutty and smooth, if a touch neutral on the nose. The palate pushes more nuts and distant white fruits, followed by a finish of fleur de sel and cashew butter. Slightly heavy but that's the style; like its sister manzanilla, this wine is very consistent year to year.",La Ina Fino,88,14.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,Domecq
142014,142014,Spain,"Quite international in style, a direct reflection of the Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah components that comprise the wine. That said, this is probably the best wine Martinez Bujanda has made at its La Mancha winery; it's plump and ripe, with nice cherry and plum flavors. It's medium in weight and length, and juicy. Likable as can be. Imported by CIV/USA.",Reserva,88,15.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Red Blend,Finca Antigua
142022,142022,Spain,"Modern in terms of its forward oak, extraction and deep color. The nose is packed with charcoal, tobacco and pepper, while the fresh, forward palate pushes cherry cola and baked fruit. Firm tannins, however, close it down, leaving a clipped finish and the perception of only moderate depth. Decant to get best results.",Grans Muralles,88,98.0,Catalonia,Conca de Barberà,,Red Blend,Torres
142023,142023,Spain,"This Bordeaux-style blend features enticing aromas of molasses, licorice, leather and plum, and while the palate satisfies, it doesn't quite live up to the hype built by the bouquet.

Traditionalist, however, may find it worthy of greater praise.",Imperial Gran Reserva,84,60.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,CVNE
142143,142143,Spain,"This wine is not up there with the bodega's top bottlings. It's rather sweet and soft, with mildly green and minty aromas.

142157,142157,Spain,"Vanilla, raisin and carob aromas announce a level of heft and overripeneness that is never lost or compensated for.

142232,142232,Spain,"Gets going in heavy, stewy fashion, with aromas of rubber, asphalt and leather.

Possibly a touch green at its core. Imported by Classical Wines.",Finca la Planeta,88,46.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pasanau Germans
142238,142238,Spain,"More of an approachable Priorat, with plump fruit and modest tannins. It's a blend of five grapes, mostly from vineyards planted in the 1990s, and the aging takes place in one-year-old French oak.

The '01 version of Termanthia is outrageously powerful and deep, like a shot to the jaw from Lennox Lewis in his prime. It's maxed out in terms of leather, smoky oak, and depth of fruit.

142615,142615,Spain,"Loaded with tropical fruit, with ample size to the nose and palate.

142719,142719,Spain,"Red cherry, cough drop and a touch of mushroom work the nose, while in the mouth it's crisp and pointed, with light red fruit and citrus-influenced flavors. A lean, lithe wine very much in the pie cherry realm.",Crianza,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
142720,142720,Spain,"This semisweet white can come across likable or awful, depending on your mood and the shape of the bottle you're drinking.

142855,142855,Spain,"Smooth, smoky and leathery is how this winner gets going, and backing that up is a palate of laser-beam intensity.

142856,142856,Spain,"René Barbier, the pioneer of Priorat, pulled together a beautiful wine in what was, at best, a mediocre vintage. Admittedly, it starts out coarse and grainy, but airing shows juicy red fruit and a level of complexity that's up there.

Better to wait for the 2004.",,83,27.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Finca Allende
143027,143027,Spain,"An attempt at high-end Tempranillo that comes across rough and tough and not too friendly. The nose is rubbery and dark, while the palate is big and generic, with chocolate on the back end. But where this wine gets you is in feel: it's a tannic monster.",Finca los Meriños,83,60.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Luberri
143075,143075,Spain,"Forceful and rustic, with aromas of barnyard, tree bark and black plum.

Leaves you wanting more.",Tinto Crianza,86,28.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Arzuaga
143081,143081,Spain,"Light and easy, with simple aromas of lemon and wildflowers. Fairly forward and pronounced in terms of fruit; the lemon, pineapple and peach are all right there and lively. Finishes smooth and easy, if maybe a touch watery.",O Deus Dionisos,86,22.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adegas Galegas
143087,143087,Spain,"A touch prickly and odd at first, with cactus and canned peaches on the nose. More canned, sweet fruit appears on the palate, which is soft and modest from front to finish. Ends with the flavor of pineapple Lifesavers.",,86,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Morgadio
143093,143093,Spain,"Ruby in color and sweet on the nose. Yes, it's a candied Grenache from central Spain, and while it doesn't overwhelm, it's steady as she goes. Plenty of raspberry and cherry on the palate is backed by a clear, focused finish. A tasty, upright, semisweet red.",,85,7.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Castillo de Monséran
143119,143119,Spain,"Butterscotch aromas are backed by a candied palate full of pear syrup. The mouthfeel is soft, and the finish everlasting due to residual sugar.

143132,143132,Spain,"Barely a step down from the more rare and pricey Pingus, the '01 Flor should fly off store shelves and restaurant wine lists.

143140,143140,Spain,"Sandeman excels with its reserve-level sherries, as is exemplified by this stand-out PX. Figs and raisins are front and center throughout, but it never sits heavily on your palate. Just the opposite, there's plow-through acidity that creates a brilliant mouthfeel and the sensation of freshness. Fabulous by itself or on top of vanilla ice cream.",Royal Ambrosante Aged 20 Years Old Solera,93,24.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Pedro Ximénez,Sandeman
143142,143142,Spain,"Undoubtedly powerful, but lovable. The nose is wholesome and complete, a blend of earth, coffee and heavy black cherry and plum aromas.

143154,143154,Spain,"Concentrated but not too heavy, at least not compared to some new-age Riojanos. Asúa shows smoky, toasty aromas and some bright cherry fruit. In the mouth, she's fresh and upright, with just a hint of Bordeaux-style leafiness but zero under ripeness. Toward the finish cola and red licorice flavors come up. Lovely and more subtle than the competition.",Real de Asúa Reserva,92,120.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
143155,143155,Spain,"My first look at this fledgling project from the folks at Osborne left me impressed. Sed de Caná is a well toasted, masculine Tempranillo with raw, smoky aromas and a broad-shouldered palate. It toes the line between spunky and tannic, but there's so much forward fruit thrown in that you can't help but like it.

143171,143171,Spain,"Big-boned and citrusy, with aromas of oranges and melon. More citrus on the palate mixes with the essence of pear and apple, while the finish is tight and rather long.

143180,143180,Spain,"Full-bodied and earthy, with red plum, cola and tomato aromas. The palate mixes leafy, herbal flavors with candied cherry, and the combination proves to have issues.

143256,143256,Spain,"Bacon, sawdust and earth along with cassis and raspberry kick start this lively, acid-driven red. The palate offers tart plum and raspberry, all steered to a point by piercing, laser-beam acidity. Oak plays a prominent role throughout, especially on the finish. The gritty tannins, firm feel and strong acids call for a few years of cellaring.",,88,50.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Alion
143267,143267,Spain,"Lush and masculine, and every bit made to emphasize extract and oak. It's dark, with heavy berry fruit, density and ripeness. On the finish it turns even darker, with bitter chocolate and wood smoke. Arguably better at first; airing seems to close it up rather than expanding it. Drink now or cellar for up to five years.",Mirto,88,37.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Ramón Bilbao
143272,143272,Spain,"Chunky and mouthfilling, but it still has lovable characteristics of briary fruit, full-bore acids and a leathery feel.

143274,143274,Spain,"For several years we've been impressed with this under-$10 Merlot, and this year the quality and purity are once again exemplary.

143275,143275,Spain,"Earthy and dark, with forward fruit and plenty of overt wood. With lots of berry fruit, a smooth feel, and fine overall integration, this is a quintessential, well-priced Spanish wine for 2004. There's no flab or fat, but it's not hard, either. A drying, coffee-filled finish with bitter chocolate is the final act.",Rívola,88,14.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Abadia Retuerta
143277,143277,Spain,"The bouquet of this aging Rioja features a good mix of berry fruit, tree bark and earth. Across the palate flows a stream of strawberry, cherry and coffee.

143278,143278,Spain,"Ruby-red and colorful, with aromas of polished, fine-grained oak. Bright and fruity, but limited when it comes to complexity. It's loaded with chocolate, licorice and espresso, while the palate feel is one of juiciness along with tight tannins. It's aggressive and muscular, not subtle.","Coleccion Privada, Unfiltered",88,38.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
143279,143279,Spain,"The bouquet offers raspberry and strawberry fruit, which is followed by a meaty mouthful of plum, coffee and bitter chocolate. The finish is defined by mocha, and the feel is derived from firm tannins. This wine feels warm, arguably borderline hot. But that's probably more a result of youth than anything else.",,88,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
143327,143327,Spain,"Stewed fruit aromas with some baked beans on the side just isn't alluring, and the lean, raw, acidic palate that some might describe as traditional isn't clicking in my book. Saving graces include milk chocolate on the finish.",Reserva,82,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Baron De Ley
143332,143332,Spain,"An earthy style with pickle barrel and leather on the nose. Dark berry flavors are muddled, and there's an odd twinge of citrus to the flavor profile.

143372,143372,Spain,"Heavy and sweaty at first, with a fat texture and forward fruit. It takes this wine a couple of minutes to show its black core and some spicy heat. Finishes with obvious flavors of oak and coffee.",,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Cosme Palacio y Hermanos
143374,143374,Spain,"Rather intense and a bit clumsy, but with solid leather, baked earth and charred aromas. The palate is roasted and heavy, with grabby tannins and awkward acids. Finishes with hints of tomato in addition to more acidity.",Reserva,85,57.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza
143375,143375,Spain,"Leather and tar up front, followed by sweet fruit with adequate depth and plenty of plum and berry. A bit soft, touching on overripe, but pretty good despite some burnt, rubbery notes to the finish.",,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Arbanta
143378,143378,Spain,"Fairly youthful, light and airy, with simple nectarine and melon flavors. Finishes smooth and medium length, with adequate but reserved force. Some finishing notes of creamy pear and sugared citrus zest work well.",viña Reboreda,85,9.0,Galicia,Ribeiro,,White Blend,Bodegas Campante
143379,143379,Spain,"An oak-aged vino joven with a nose of cherry, rubber and raspberry. At first taste, it seems overtly buttery, as if the young oak were sitting atop the wine. As you get into it, that oak seems less obvious and more integrated. Still, it's a touch bland, yet competent.",Roble,85,17.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Carmelo Rodero

143393,143393,Spain,"Lots of early mint and wood, but then it loses clarity with airing.

Not a lot of nuance here but it's still good.",Crianza,85,15.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Vega Sauco
143425,143425,Spain,"A bit gaseous and funky, with simple dried-cherry and slightly mealy citrus flavors. Gets better with time but never really impresses. Not musty but definitely less than fresh.",Rosé Brut,81,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
143433,143433,Spain,"This wine shows that old dogs can be taught new tricks. Murrieta is about as traditional as they come in Rioja yet Dalmau is ultra modern. The nose is a smooth mix of plum, raspberry and tobacco, while the sizable palate pushes oak-backed berry fruit. Runs racy but not particularly aggressive. Long and satisfying on the finish.",Dalmau Reserva,92,,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Marqués de Murrieta
143434,143434,Spain,"This rather unique wine (made from Mencía) is at the vanguard of the Bierzo revival. It's earthy and leafy, with aromas of red plums and natural spice.

143445,143445,Spain,"From the outset, this beauty oozes character. The whole exceeds the parts by a sum of three, as the wine delivers full flavors, complexity and a near Burgundian minerality.

Simply delicious.",Cepas Vellas,92,33.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Do Ferreiro
143455,143455,Spain,"Alvaro Palacios is indeed a great winemaker, as is evidenced by this blend of Garnacha, Tempranillo, Graciano and Mazuelo. Aromas of bright cherry signify power and structure, yet it's easy as sin to drink. Shows model integration, bursting berry flavors and ripe tannins. Tasted several times during the past year but not rated until now; this wine just keeps getting better.",Propiedad Herencia Remondo,92,28.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Red Blend,Palacios Remondo
143473,143473,Spain,"This Ribera workhorse from before the time RDD was a hot region hangs in there. The rooty nose springs with cola and spice along with dried fruits.

An easy food wine; mature now but with some life still in it.",Reserva,86,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
143481,143481,Spain,"Subtlety is not in the calling here. The nose is chunky, with leather and scattered fruit. Sweet plum and berry fruit is bolstered by forward acidity. Condensed and short, but undoubtedly lively.",Lealtanza Reserva,85,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza
143486,143486,Spain,"Despite heavy oak, this wine is lean and jagged, with sharp cherry and plum flavors offset by some spice. Quite woody throughout, with a warm, solid finish.

143552,143552,Spain,"This is a new wine made by Alejandro Fernandez of Pesquera in Ribera del Duero. It's clear, defined and ripe, with earthy, spicy undercurrents supporting potent blackberry fruit. The chewy, deep palate is solid and saturated, leading into a coffee-tinged finish that carries echoes of chocolate. The tannins get larger with each passing minute; drink this with food.",Reserva,88,19.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,El Vinculo
143554,143554,Spain,"Flowery, with a nice mix of sweetness, dried apricots and vanilla. Flavors of banana, papaya and apple dominate a textured, modestly rich palate.

143561,143561,Spain,"A touch creamy and lactic at first, but it picks up leathery, more rustic notes with airing.

Maybe it's a bit basic, but it's juicy, well made and tasty.",Vi de Guarda,88,48.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Morlanda
143564,143564,Spain,"With its succulent floral aromas, you almost have to be drawn in. Flavors of melon, apple and banana are lengthy and delicious. The only stumbling block is a flat mouthfeel, which some might call plump. Shockingly, this wine is made mostly from the pedestrian Airen grape.",Protocolo Blanco,87,6.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,White Blend,Dominio de Eguren
143569,143569,Spain,"Jammy and sweet up front, and almost like a fruit roll-up as far as aromatics go. The palate is chewy and sweet, with boysenberry and plum flavors.

143570,143570,Spain,"Pretty and lush, with a succulent nose. The palate is young, bright and fruity, with lots of raspberry flavor. The tail end is solid, balanced and expansive.

143571,143571,Spain,"Rusty in color, with hickory, leather and dried currants on the traditional Rioja nose. More dried fruit creates a spicy palate, one with cinnamon, pepper and clove.

143573,143573,Spain,"The nose is generally sweet and likable, yet there's some medicinal character in there too.

143612,143612,Spain,"Never let the price tag dictate perceived quality; you may be disappointed. This tart, choppy, clumsily extracted Tempranillo is a case in point. Where's the balance and mouthfeel? This is why we blind-taste; save your $350.",,81,354.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Contador
143623,143623,Spain,"We are big fans of most Sierra Cantabria wines, but this fading, overoaked white Rioja is more or less a dud.

143627,143627,Spain,". Stand up and take note: this is great wine from Priorat. And that's regardless of whether it is typically Priorato in style. It trades textbook minerality for lushness, and the fruit is star quality. In the mouth, there's an explosion of grape matter that leaves coffee, chocolate, peanut brittle and vanilla. Almost drinkable right now but best from 2009.",,96,85.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Vall Llach

Mature.",Ill Lustros Gran Reserva,91,,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
143708,143708,Spain,"Hard and tannic to start with, so it really needs time. Aromas of beef bullion, jerky and soy convey a certain smokiness, which is more geared to the nose than the palate. As for taste, it's laced with black cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and chocolate. Very tight and firm, so hold for another three years.",El Bosque,91,138.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Sierra Cantabria
143723,143723,Spain,"More jammy than previous vintages, with blackberry aromas and notes of bitter dark chocolate.

Hold a few years, if possible.",Vino Tinto,91,94.0,Catalonia,Priorat,,Red Blend,Vall Llach
143725,143725,Spain,"A poster child for modern Rioja. Seriously extracted, with saturated blackberry, cola and chocolate aromas. Features excellent texture and a fine, tannic finish.

143786,143786,Spain,"This five-grape blend is based on Treixadura but also includes Albariño, Loureira, Lado and Torrontès.

Pour yourself a copita of this beauty and sip it while munching some olives, peanuts or pistachios. Shazzam! You're transported to a whitewashed village in Andalusia. Aromas of mushroom and yeast are just as they should be. And deep within are subtle flavors of marzipan and citrus.

143860,143860,Spain,"Lovers of full-bodied, extracted Priorat wines know Vall Llach, and that cult sees Embruix as a good value. The 2004 is on the right track: the nose is almost impenetrable as it oozes blackberry, tar and fine leather. Meanwhile, the palate is like warm berry compote followed by espresso and dark chocolate.

143865,143865,Spain,"Powerful is almost an understatement in describing this big boy. The nose starts out fiery and rough before settling to intense.

Stylish but forward; it's a wine most anyone should like.",Baltos,90,16.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
145280,145280,Spain,"This wine shows the potential and power of Valdeorras Godello, but at a fair price. It has a lot of minerality and acidity, but also a boatload of kiwi, green apple, papaya and white pepper. Unconventional for Spanish white wines and very much worth a look.",Val de Sil,90,18.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Bodegas Valderroa
145305,145305,Spain,"Perfectly approachable and wholesome. Aromas of bread dough, pear and lemon-lime are alert and attractive.

145320,145320,Spain,"Big and yellow, which is evidence of the oak aging on this plump, modern Verdejo that's made in small quantity and will appeal to those who like things such as Sémillon and Chenin Blanc. The body is full, there's fruit, weight and grip, and the ripeness versus minerality is just right. Drink now with cheese or fish. 300 cases produced.",Naiades,89,28.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Naia
145333,145333,Spain,"Dry, smoky and lightly fruity, this Pinot Noir-based Cava is about as good as it gets in the price range. The nose delivers distant brown sugar and burnt leaves, while the palate lays on the orange rind, peach and cherry skin flavors. Try this classy sparkler; you won't be disappointed.",Rosé Brut Reserva,89,15.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
145401,145401,Spain,"A modern-style offering from the up-and-coming region of Yecla, near Alicante. The grape used is Monastrell, a k a Mourvèdre. It's bold and packed with blackberry, pepper and other spices. It's the perfect wine to enjoy with barbecue, stews and roasts. This wine busted onto the scene just a couple of years ago, earning accolades for its full flavors and overall character. For the price, it's a big-time bargain.",Hécula,90,12.0,Levante,Yecla,,Monastrell,Castaño
145489,145489,Spain,"A barrel-fermented Verdejo, which will work for some and seem wrong to others. The nose is wood-heavy, with smoke, butterscotch and licorice. In the mouth, it's ripe and full of spiced pear and vanilla flavors. A one-trick pony in that it's dominated by oak. Still, the quality of the fruit and oak is solid.",Naia Des,88,28.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Viña Sila
145563,145563,Spain,"More available than most Valdeorras wines—and very good in 2005—Godeval offers a no-nonsense version of the Godello grape.

145576,145576,Spain,"This winery, with its sketched labels, is classic O Rosal. The wine is 90% Albariño and Loureira, with some Caino Blanca thrown in.

145577,145577,Spain,"Clean and expressive up front, with floral aromas shaped by doses of grass, apple and pear. Tastes very good, with condensed fruit creating a nice mouthfeel. Very long on the back end.",Val do Sosego,89,,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,As Laxas
145583,145583,Spain,"Perfectly crisp and fresh, with touches of tangerine and lemon making it slightly sharp but not the least bit sour. More of a zesty version, with correct acidity, ripeness and balance. Yet another fine match for seafood.",,89,19.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Pazo San Mauro
145588,145588,Spain,"All the wines in the Abadal line seem commited to serious aromas and flavors supported by honest structure.

Integrated and properlly welded by firm tannins.",Abadal,89,16.0,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,,Merlot,Masies d'Avinyo
145589,145589,Spain,"La Val is an O Rosal winery but its wines are 100% Albariño. This estate-grown white offers a yellowish tint with pretty aromas of buttercup and apple blossoms.

145623,145623,Spain,"Spicy and savory smelling, with interesting aromas that encompass maple, chili powder, smoked meat and mildly baked berries.

145638,145638,Spain,"If you don't mind some heavy barrel char, then you'll probably like this rough rider. It has espresso and asphalt on the nose, and then you get leathery plum and berry fruit on the palate. A good wine, with a long finish, lots of oak and overall balance. In a nutshell, there's plenty going on.",Valdunes,89,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Tierra Adentro
145643,145643,Spain,"Not often do you come across an aged Valdepeñas red, especially one with style, structure and character.

145645,145645,Spain,"Scala Dei seems to have managed 2003's tough conditions, and this is endowed with sweet Garnacha-driven aromas that touch up against raisiny but don't cross the line.

145806,145806,Spain,"Starts shy, but then reveals a smoky nose of dried cherries and freshly fallen leaves. Still fairly youthful on the palate, where plum and cherry flavors are braced by a ripping note of hickory smoke. Barrel notes take over on the finish, but overall it has a lot of what you want from a 21st-century Rioja.",Reserva,88,28.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Darien
145809,145809,Spain,"Round and nutty, with mild floral and honey hints up front.

Slight mushroom and iodine notes appear on the finish.",Tio Pepe Fino,88,,Andalucia,Jerez,,Sherry,González Byass
145811,145811,Spain,"An example of a well-made, lightweight red that puts clarity and freshness ahead of bulk and oak.

145826,145826,Spain,"La Ina always has its own likable style. It's fresh, with plenty of apple character, and always dry as a bone.

145827,145827,Spain,"Sweet and candied on the nose, which  draws you in. Runs a touch chunky, with plum and licorice flavors. Good acidity creates a racy mouthfeel, even teetering on fiery.

145869,145869,Spain,"Zesty as all get out, with a touch of spritz. Full melon, nectarine and green-herb aromas set the stage for apricot, peach and citrus flavors. Hails from Condado do Tea and seems racier than most.",Laxas,89,,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,As Laxas
145883,145883,Spain,"Lucid in appearance, with mineral aromas adding complexity to the otherwise clean, floral nose. Very dry in style, with apple and pineapple flavors.

145905,145905,Spain,"More open than many, with lemon-lime aromas that work as a nice entry. Full in the mouth, where mixed fruits mesh together.

145915,145915,Spain,"Regal in presentation, with its faux-metal label and broad-based bottle. And in every edition it's one of Spain's more elegant, serious cavas.

145936,145936,Spain,"Plenty of intense new oak sets the nose in a direction toward mint, licorice and black pepper.

145941,145941,Spain,"Nicely balanced and a better example of the upside of Navarra than the wines that are based on or include Merlot. The nose shows some herbal character but more deep fruit notes.

145947,145947,Spain,"Carchelo is at its best in this vintage. This is loaded with wild blackberry and leathery sass, too.

145989,145989,Spain,"Simple elegance defines this rosado. The color is perfect, the nose is bright, the fruit is forward…everything is in place. Isaac Muga and his sons know how to make rosé. They emphasize flashy fruit and a pure finish, while eschewing oak and weight. Every restaurant in America should serve this beauty by the glass, and every wine drinker should try it at least once. Impeccable with salads.",Muga,89,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Rosé,Muga
146100,146100,Spain,"Hailing from a more obscure mountainous region, this Chardonnay-based white blend is a potent brew.

146105,146105,Spain,"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet.

Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Pazo Piñeiro,88,35.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Lusco
146108,146108,Spain,"Sweet and grapy on first look, but shows more complexity once you get into it. Rich plum and other black fruits carry the bulky, sizable palate.

146109,146109,Spain,"Leathery and smoky, with woodsy aromas as well as the essence of dried red fruits.

146110,146110,Spain,"The crude oil of PX Sherries, Noe won't appeal to everyone. For starters, it's thick as molasses, with heavy caramel and toffee aromas and flavors.

146114,146114,Spain,"Starts with a big, dusty nose of cherry, blackberry and forest notes. Fresh and proper on the palate, with plum and boysenberry.

146115,146115,Spain,"There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese. It's not a perfect bouquet, but it is intriguing. In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity.",Molino Real Mountain Wine,88,48.0,Andalucia,Málaga,,Moscatel,Telmo Rodríguez
146125,146125,Spain,"Kicks off with a bouquet akin to chocolate-covered cherries before moving on to cured meat and bacon.

Shows much of what's good about this appellation.",Reserva,87,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Valdubón
146127,146127,Spain,"Begins with tight sulfuric aromas that transform into rubber and red fruit. Flavors of cherry, plum and dried herbs are tart and precise, while the finish offers some tomato.

146128,146128,Spain,"This well-priced red from Tarragona shows a glimpse of what the Montsant region can produce. The nose is all red fruit, with a splinter of oak.

146166,146166,Spain,"A year and a half ago this wine came acorss ripe, robust and not the least bit rustic. But now it's showing many signs of the hot 2003 vintage, including a soft structure and some stewy, leather notes.

146169,146169,Spain,"More than 80,000 cases of this wine were made, making it “mass” by local standards. But that doesn't mean it's not a quality white.

146182,146182,Spain,"You won't find a better, more affordable Bierzo than this. It carries true terroir, heft and solidity but it's not that complicated or racy.

146183,146183,Spain,"Floral, with buttercup and acacia on the nose. The mouth, however, is a bit more austere and sharp-edged.

146207,146207,Spain,"Fairly big and yeasty, with earth and mushroom notes that offer complexity to the apple and pear aromas that dominate. Fruity enough, with hints of nutmeg and white pepper.

146224,146224,Spain,"Toasty, yeasty and quite composed given the price point.

146244,146244,Spain,"Brutal heat didn't do a lot for Mas La Plana in 2003. While still a worthy wine, this one shows some green on the nose and palate, while the balance is weightier than normal. In its favor, there's bold blackberry and a touch of cola on the palate. Good but not up to the wine's usual high standards.",Mas La Plana,88,50.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Torres
146412,146412,Spain,"Offers an attractive mix of herb, oak and ripe fruit aromas. The palate is sunny, and thus bright fruit in the form of raspberry and cherry shines.

146429,146429,Spain,"Thinning, but with catchy aromas of leather, citrus peel, forest floor and cola. The palate offers sweeping dried fruits, mostly cassis and cherry.

Interestingly, root beer and turnip show up at the very end.",Gran Reserva,87,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Montecillo
146445,146445,Spain,"Starts out flowery and tropical, which is likely a reflection of the 20% Loureira in the wine. The flavor profile is dominated by peach and apple, while the finish runs long due to an infusion of Caino Blanca.

146618,146618,Spain,"Chunky and ripe, with more power and potency than precision or finesse. Which still means it's pleasant, warm and tasty.

146633,146633,Spain,"Quite hard on the nose, with classic petrol aromas that almost smell of rubber cement. Tough and tight on the palate; it takes some effort to penetrate.

146670,146670,Spain,"Round and fruity, with sweet, attractive aromas. The palate is a bit dark for cava, with plum and bitter chocolate flavors.

146672,146672,Spain,"Open and floral, with acacia and orange blossom on the nose. The palate is full-bore citrus, dealing orange and pink grapefruit. Lots of acidity and still full-bodied, with a solid finish that's zesty and lasting. Nice brut cava; offers more than average. Imported by Classical Wines.",Extremarium Brut,88,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
146681,146681,Spain,"Crisp and clean, thus it qualifies as a perfect apéritif wine. Secure in its apple and slate aromas and flavors, with a firm but persistent bead that fosters a fine mouthfeel. Best with nuts, olives, chips and especially seafood.",Reserva Raventós Brut,88,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Codorníu
146695,146695,Spain,"Nice and fresh, with defined, attractive apple and pear aromas. Dry and fruity in the mouth, with a tad of sweetness to the firm papaya, lime and apple flavors. Ripe and round enough, with balance. The total packagein cava. Imported by Classical Wines.",Reserva Brut,88,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
146824,146824,Spain,"Seems a touch green and stripped at first, but airing brings it around. Still, there's a lot of fresh wood and resin, which somewhat masks the plum and berry fruit that's eager to emerge. Spicy on the finish, with a decent feel.",,86,19.0,Catalonia,Montsant,,Red Blend,Clos Dels Coduls
146832,146832,Spain,"Meaty on the nose, with chunky leather aromas along with mature fruit. In the mouth, it's a touch racy and acidic, which serves to bolster its raspberry and pie-cherry personality. Pretty good overall, with a sizable allotment of zest.",Reserva,86,47.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Altanza
146835,146835,Spain,"Lean on the bouquet; there's almost zero yeast or lees character. But there is an interesting smoked-meat aroma that conjures memories of sausage or ballpark franks. Aggressive in the mouth, with green herbs and paprika. An unusual cava with confusing characteristics.",Aniversario PA 84 Brut Nature,86,70.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Parxet
146836,146836,Spain,"Quite aggressive and murky at first, with a gassy, heavy bouquet of leather, earth and cooked plums. A lot of dryness comes out on the palate, courtesy of starchy tannins and medium-weight red fruit. Finishes with grip, size and a heavy hand. For best results, give it as much time as you can.",Elite,86,55.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
146837,146837,Spain,"Saucy and mildly seductive, with aromas of herbs, leather and exotic spices. In the mouth, however, things seem a touch rustic and burnt. The palate carries some serious zing and spice, but to call it smooth would be a stretch.",Gran Reserva,86,30.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Viña Mayor
146845,146845,Spain,"Fat and melony on the nose, with tons of pear, cantaloupe, almond and vanilla on the palate. Heavily oaked, especially on the finish, where wood resin is mostly what you get.",Vinya Gigi,86,29.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Chardonnay,Jean León
146848,146848,Spain,"Riper and deeper than some in this class, but arguably overoaked and roasted, such that the finish tastes like burnt coffee and the bouquet smells of peeled tire rubber. In between look for plum, blackberry, cumin and black pepper.",Crianza,86,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Prado Rey
146849,146849,Spain,"This basic RdD delivers a smooth, ripe nose with doses of forest, bacon, road tar and violets, and there's some plum and blackberry at the foundation. Juicy and raw on the tongue, with racy, slick blackberry fruit. Finishes broad and medicinal, likely a sign of the hot vintage.",,86,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tempranillo,Valdubón
146852,146852,Spain,"Ripe yet a bit chunky, probably a reflection of this estate's somewhat inland location. Shows sweet grapefruit and almond flavors, with a touch of pithy bitterness on the finish. This winery is owned by Marqués de Murrieta of Rioja fame.",,87,14.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Pazo de Barrantes
146866,146866,Spain,"A lower selection of grapes than the winery's superior Dona Rosa results in a fresh wine full of apple, nectarine and minerality. Not particularly complex but goes down nicely. Classic everyday Albariño.",Alba Rosa,87,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Adega Martínez Serantes
146868,146868,Spain,"Crisply made, with a strong emphasis on green apples. This is a zesty, flinty white made for warm-weather drinking. Despite being 100% Godello it has a lot in common with Sauvignon Blanc.",Montenovo,87,10.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Bodegas Valderroa
146869,146869,Spain,"A bit zesty to start, with a touch of mineral on the nose. Flavorwise, we're talking apple, peach and nectarine. A solid wine with good balance and nothing out or the ordinary.",,87,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Valmiñor
146875,146875,Spain,"Pineapple, melon and mineral on the nose are welcoming aromas. The mouth is nice, with citrus and melon flavors. Plenty of feel and body, and pleasantly wet, meaning it's fresh, properly acidic and refreshing.",,87,27.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Pazo de Eiras
146893,146893,Spain,"Easygoing and balanced, with cream soda and vanilla aromas setting up orange, tangerine and green apple flavors. Crisp and right on the palate, with flowing acidity. Solid, with a touch of green herbs. Imported by Freixenet USA.",Brut Nature,88,14.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
147041,147041,Spain,"Bulky and ripe, with raspberry and punch-like aromas. If you like sweet notes like kirsch, sugar beets and coulis, this has it. Clearly the wine reflects the hot vintage, so it's soft, chewy and bent on sweetness. Good, but not an ager.",Tinto,86,9.0,Catalonia,Catalonia,,Red Blend,Mas Marçal
147043,147043,Spain,"A bulky, fruity style of cava that begins with aromas of floor polish, fruit essence and roasted corn.

Crisp and apple-based late, but never exciting enough to stir fandom.",Extremarium,86,16.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Mont Marçal
147046,147046,Spain,"Typically amber in color, with aromas of dried cherries merging into apricots. Tangy and sharp on the palate, as is standard.

147053,147053,Spain,"Extracted and raw, but with enough rustic country charm to make it worth a go. Four major grapes were thrown together, yielding cherry, beet and tomato aromas. The palate is ripe and edgy, with red plum and herb flavors. A tight, basic wine with ample tannin and acid.",ADA,86,10.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Zubastía
147054,147054,Spain,"Shows hickory-style wood aromas along with jerky, briar patch and cherry. Fairly fresh and forward, with a tangy palate dealing standard berry-cherry fare. Tight on the finish, with chocolate, pepper and coffee notes. A cut above the mass-market products; quite acceptable for the price",Roble,86,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
147072,147072,Spain,"Mildly sweet but not very exact or dilineated on the nose. Flavors of lime, papaya and apple run toward green, but with good snap and zest the wine makes the grade. Finishes dry and snappy, with medium depth.",,86,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Serra da Estrela
147076,147076,Spain,"The gold color and heavy oak aromas indicate barrel fermentation, which for this reviewer is not the ideal way to produce Verdejo. That said, this wine is made well, with plump melon and apple flavors cuddled in vanilla and wood resin. Very thick and woody; like being lost in the forest.",Fuente Elvira,86,22.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
147078,147078,Spain,"Fairly mineral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas rounding out the bouquet. Quite fresh and crisp, yet a bit hollow in the midpalate and on the finish.

147247,147247,Spain,"Exhibits dry red fruits and mushroom on the nose, with accents of forest and spice. Somewhat minty and forward on the palate, and arguably a touch gritty and sweet.

147261,147261,Spain,"Not a bad little quaffer. From Martinez-Bujanda, this colorful, ripe red is solid and chunky, with sweet aromas of berries and black plum. It is what you would call straightforward, with little to no complexity but lots of girth. Finishes full, almost creamy.",,85,10.0,Central Spain,La Mancha,,Tempranillo,Finca Antigua
147266,147266,Spain,"More heavy and ripe than expected, with a creamy, almost lactic nose. Round on the palate, with plum and black-cherry fruit. Good acidity and overall balance keep it afloat. Finishes with coffee, chocolate and spice. Not a world beater but good.",Hombros,85,22.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,,Mencía,Casar de Burbia
147267,147267,Spain,"From Bodegas Bretón, this medium-weight red is a touch stewy, with peanut and black-olive aromas along with red licorice and Tootsie Roll.

147274,147274,Spain,"Good but a bit less concentrated and pure than most. There's a whiff of sulfur on the nose, and in the mouth the fruit is solid but basic. Apple and melon are the key flavors, while the finish is clean but unspectacular. At 40,000 cases this is a large-production wine by Rías Baixas standards.",,85,,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,La Val
147275,147275,Spain,"Gets off on the wrong foot, with aromas of corn and overripe apples. It steadies itself on the palate, where it's still sort of candied, with mango and cantaloupe stepping up. Has its qualities and registers entirely inoffensive. Good wine but not exciting.",,85,12.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Valdelapinta
147278,147278,Spain,"Raisin and liqueur carry the oaked nose, yet the palate is quite hard and tannic. Reduced a bit across the tongue, with prune, milk chocolate and beet nots. Has power and a high price tag, but it fails to stir the beast.",Sango,85,55.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Rejadorada
147280,147280,Spain,"Shows ample apple, pineapple and apricot on the nose, and follows with sweet melon, lime and other tropical fruit flavors.

147282,147282,Spain,"A 50/50 blend of Verdejo and Viura that focuses on aromas of green herbs, citrus and nettles. The palate offers nice grapefruit and green papaya flavors, and they are backed by a smooth, medium-length finish.",Vina Mocen,85,10.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,White Blend,Bodegas Antano
147286,147286,Spain,"Bacon and leather meld with modest black-fruit aromas on the nose of this Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon-Bobal blend. It's fairly plump, with blackberry and vanilla flavors. Ripe and tasty enough, but neither elevated nor complex.",Ceremonia Reserva De Autor,85,15.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo,Vicente Gandia
147289,147289,Spain,"A black-colored, deeply extracted wine with charcoal, mint and burnt berry aromas. The palate is certainly ripe, as plum and berry flavors hit hard. But it's also limited in scope and complexity. A big wine with average personality. The blend is Tempranillo-Bobal-Syrah.",,85,20.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo Blend,Solo
147290,147290,Spain,"A touch awkward to begin with, as the bouquet exhibits corn and hay along with ripe apple. The palate offers plenty of sweet, round flavors, particularly spiced apple and quince. Finishes soft, almost lazy. Good and ripe; not too acidic.",,85,18.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,,Verdejo,Aura
147299,147299,Spain,"Gold in color, with musky aromas that feature hints of butterscotch, ham and spice. Runs more racy in the mouth, with big lemon, orange and passion fruit flavors.

147316,147316,Spain,"Apple to start with, with some sweet doughiness to ease things along. Rather crisp and dry, which is all very classic.

Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Eric Brut Nature,87,22.0,Catalonia,Cava,,White Blend,Vallformosa
147328,147328,Spain,"Classic and austere, with light toast and vanilla aromas in front of stark green apple and lime flavors.

147421,147421,Spain,"Light as if it were even older than it is, but nicely perfumed and mild in scope. The nose is mature and woodsy, while the palate is light, acidic and still dancing with plum and cherry. Best if you don't expect too much from it.",Crianza,85,16.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Zitua
147423,147423,Spain,"A bit sweet on the nose, with notes of caramel, blackberry and earth. Better at first, where it comes on ripe. But then it turns a little sluggish and heavy as it opens. Still, it's largely a good Rioja, maybe more in the “modern” style than old-school.",Reserva,85,24.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Origin
147430,147430,Spain,"Rich and creamy, but lacks zest and drive. The nose and palate offer sweet banana and oak, while the feel is almost too pillowy. Tastes more like a dessert than a dry white should. Still, it's neither bad nor poorly made.",Fermentado en Barrica de Roble,85,,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Chardonnay,Enate
147438,147438,Spain,"More minty oak than fruit on the nose, with simple but clean candied fruit flavors. A bit short on depth and complexity, but totally drinkable, especially after some airing. Decent texture to the finish, with leftover spice and wood-based flavors.",Hoya De Cadenas Reserva Prevada,85,11.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Vicente Gandia
147441,147441,Spain,"Starts with appropriate earth, cherry and vanilla notes, which are followed by spicy cherry, cranberry and raspberry flavors.

147448,147448,Spain,"Lean and woody, with mint, herbs and sawdust on the nose. The palate is surprisingly saturated and healthy, with pepper and vanilla running side by side with dry cherry and raspberry. A bit scouring and tannic.",Crianza,85,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Torres de Anguix
147451,147451,Spain,"A bit foresty and damp at first and then more open, fruity and lush later. The palate offers mostly snappy black cherry and cassis, while the finish is short but sturdy, with mild oak notes and decent tannins. Improves upon airing and will go with most foods.",Clos Maset Selección Especial,85,30.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vallformosa
147452,147452,Spain,"Grassy apple aromas carry a note of pickle, while the palate is chunky, full and delivers melon, pear and almond flavors. Chalk, mineral and green herbs are the secondary characteristics. Dry and long in the mouth.",,85,18.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,,Godello,Viña Somoza
147460,147460,Spain,"This Tempranillo is spicy and solid enough. The wine comes across ripe and clean, with forward cherry and raspberry flavors.

147463,147463,Spain,"Young and jumpy is this blend of Cabernet, Tempranillo and Merlot. The nose is dense and woody, with charcoal darkness. Tart blackberry flavors control the oily palate. Seems to be all over the place but goes down fairly well.",Crianza,85,19.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Red Blend,Arteaga
147476,147476,Spain,"Slightly vegetal and green, with spicy, herbal aromas mixed with oak and earth. The palate is kind of light and leafy for a Cab-Merlot blend, but there's enough body and mouthfeel to keep it moving in the right direction. Decent but weighed down by the veggies.",Crianza,84,14.0,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Bacasis
147485,147485,Spain,"Creamy and yeasty, with mild apple and bread-based aromas. Nice in the mouth, with citrus leading the way. Shows ample kick and acidity, with length and balance on the finish.

147493,147493,Spain,"Different from the crowd. The nose concedes light raspberry and cranberry aromas, while the palate is a pink passion play that's not that easy to figure out.

147605,147605,Spain,"Toast, butterscotch and oxidized apple aromas precede a heavy, nearly overripe palate loaded down with sticky apple, nectarine and banana.

147606,147606,Spain,"Earthy and ripe, with jammy, borderline stewy fruit that carries a meaty edge. Fairly one-line in terms of complexity, but it stands on its feet and tastes pretty solid. With some rustic character, it'll do the job.",50th Aniversario Sangre de Toro,85,10.0,Catalonia,Catalonia,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Torres
147614,147614,Spain,"If it seems dirty at first, time will reveal tobacco and leather aromas along with black plum and coffee. Seems more sour than you might expect, with pie cherry and rhubarb flavors. Really high-toned on the finish, where it teeters on the brink of sour. Not bad but not endearing.",Reserva,84,27.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Blasón de San Juan
147615,147615,Spain,"Tons of color but the nose is a bit soupy, with aromas of heavy oak, black fruit, tomato and herbs. A blend of 60% Garnacha and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon that's solid but shrill. Hits with extract and tannins, but the integration and flavors don't quite achieve the next level.",Tinto,84,20.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Red Blend,Care
147618,147618,Spain,"Plump and a bit stewy, but the flavors manage to take over in a fairly positive way. Upon sipping you take in blackberry and prune, but also some murkiness. Not much in the midpalate, but decent around the edges.",Crianza,84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Valcortes
147619,147619,Spain,"Muddled to start, with chocolate and earth aromas along with heavy, seemingly chewable berry fruit.

147636,147636,Spain,"Starts by emitting baked plum and leather aromas, and the bouquet is backed by solid but lean black cherry, plum and raspberry flavors.

147648,147648,Spain,"Honey, pear and sugar cane are the dominating flavors in thi sticky, rich, unctuous sweet wine.

147649,147649,Spain,"Light and sweet to the nose, with aromas of honey, which isn't normal for the usually zesty, citrusy Verdejo.

147688,147688,Spain,"Light and lean, with lively fruit aromas and flavors. Freshness is what this wine pushes, because there's not much weight or overt sweetness to it.

147792,147792,Spain,"Some heft and richness propel this bargain wine to a higher level. There are even some bacon, beef and leather aromas in addition to the plump fruit scents.

147824,147824,Spain,"This perennial bargain-basement red offers solid fruit with herbal overtones, while the flavor profile veers toward cherries and licorice. Gets raisiny and more ponderous the more time you spend analyzing it.",,83,7.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Tempranillo,René Barbier
147830,147830,Spain,"Dry leather, leaves, burnt spice and pepper lead it off, followed by tart flavors of plum and berry. Never seems to find a higher level of quality as it falls off on the palate, finishing with rhubarb and cranberry.",Higueruela,83,10.0,Central Spain,Almansa,,Red Blend,Bodegas Tintoralba
147831,147831,Spain,"Dark and smoky, almost like a burnt wooden match on top of plum purée. Runs a bit tart in the mouth for Syrah, with red raspberry and cherry flavors. Firm and lean in the mouth.",Mas La Roca Selección Especial,83,30.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Syrah,Vallformosa
147835,147835,Spain,"Prieto Picudo is the grape, and the wine yields robust aromas of radish and red fruits. Very tangy, almost citrusy on the palate. Finishes quite lean and tart. A screechy wine without a lot of happiness.",VCZ Molendores,83,15.0,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,,Prieto Picudo,Villacezan
147837,147837,Spain,"Hard and waxy on the nose, with little to no appealing fruit aromas. The palate is loaded with sharp lemon and green apple flavors. Lacks friendliness; healthy in terms of feel but borders on sour.",,82,15.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Mar de Frades
147856,147856,Spain,"Cherry and dusty cinnamon aromas blend with a touch of cough drop on the nose, while the full-bodied palate pits spicy berry and plum against rather soft acidity. Finishes sweet for a burst, then dry and peppery. Alluring rosado. Imported by European Cellars.",Grand Cuvée Rosé,87,35.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
147967,147967,Spain,"Sweet yet snappy, with youthful aromas of candied fruit. Slightly tangy on the tongue, with raspberry and plum flavors. Tastes clean, with a soft mouthfeel. Very standard, simple and easygoing.",Dehesa de Villacezan,84,11.0,Northern Spain,Vino Tierra de León,,Red Blend,Villacezan
147968,147968,Spain,"On one hand it shows black cherry, plum and licorice. On the other there are green, lettuce-like aromas and flavors. Along the way is some tang on the palate, length to the herbal finish, and an adequate mouthfeel.",Cosecha de Familia Félix Martinez Reserva,84,45.0,Central Spain,Vinos de Madrid,,Red Blend,Vinos Jeromin
147969,147969,Spain,"Black in color and saturated with plum, fruit cake and vanilla aromas. Big in the mouth but clumsy, with dense, thumping black cherry and blackberry flavors. In fact, everything about the wine is black, including the burnt, licorice-tinged finish. Ponderous in the long run.",Tinto,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Tinto del Pais,Torres de Anguix
147974,147974,Spain,"A little heavier than ideal, with a touch of raisin along with candied black cherry on the bouquet. Better in the mouth, where it comes to life on the wings of good acids, modest tannins, and simple but proper berry fruit flavors.",Crianza,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas LAN
147977,147977,Spain,"Starts somewhat cooked and stewy before finding a better, fresher, fruitier groove. Weighty and full, with bright colors and aggressive flavors. Plum, berry and cherry notes dominate. Persistent airing unveils additional ripeness and soft tannins.",Nerola,84,20.0,Catalonia,Catalonia,,Red Blend,Torres
147983,147983,Spain,"Very sweet, with cherry cola and licorice nibs comprising the nose. It's nothing more than simple Garnacha, which means it's all about red fruit and sunshine. Not a fine wine, but good for those with a sweet tooth.",Tinto,84,7.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,,Grenache,Marqués de Reala
147986,147986,Spain,"This co-op wine is almost a good deal, but ultimately it does not show enough depth or elegance to reach the next level. The nose is a touch stewy and lifeless, while the palate offers chewy raisin, plum and berry. Flat on the finish, with a syrupy feel.",,83,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Don Ramón
147991,147991,Spain,"Yellow in color and heavy on the nose. Toast is the lead aroma, and with that there's some caramel and peanut butter. Dry and lean in the mouth, with lemon and grapefruit notes. Still, it has class and style to it; not a dullard. Fairly unique. Imported by CIV/USA.",Brut Nature,87,15.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Cristalino
148022,148022,Spain,"Mildly sulfuric, with vitamin, bitter greens and funk on the nose. Melon and banana flavors are of the soft, dilute type. Seems burnt and herbal. Not fresh enough.",Linea d'Oro Chardonnay & Xarel-Lo,82,10.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,White Blend,Mederaño
148024,148024,Spain,"A ton of bell pepper and tomato sits front and center on the nose, which almost ensures that the flavors will be herbal and leafy. They are, yet the feel in the mouth is decent and the tannin-acid balance adequate. A blend of 50% each Cabernet and Merlot.",Crianza,82,18.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Conde de Olzinellas
148026,148026,Spain,"Brass colored, with aromas of apple cider and mineral. Heavy in the mouth with jumpy, tangy fruit and overt acidity. Okay if a bit mealy.",,82,22.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Mar de Viñas
148030,148030,Spain,"Roasted and hard from the initial take, with earthy, leathery aromas that don't illicit a smile. Tart, dilute and fading, with apple and cherry skin on the palate. Quite sour and thin at this point of its evolution and surely not getting better. Imported by Kensington Distributors Inc.",Reserva,81,18.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon,Señorío de Sarria
148031,148031,Spain,"Mealy on the nose, with corn and pear syrup making for a less than fresh bouquet. Bland apple and orange flavors are okay but not that stimulating, while the overall take is that it tastes too much like citrus juice and not enough like balanced wine.",,81,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,,Albariño,Soleira
148032,148032,Spain,"Violet in color, with burnt rubber, cherry and plum on the lively nose. Things go south from there, however, as the palate is too snappy and austere to support the flavors. It's 90% Carignan and much like a tart Italian Dolcetto. Imported by Hand Picked Selections.",Carinyena,81,11.0,Catalonia,Terra Alta,,Carignane,Arcs
148034,148034,Spain,"Thick on the nose, with prickly, mildly pickled aromas. Typical of Jumilla, the wine is big and candied, with soft tannins and spiky, out-of-place acidity. Finishes tart and crisp with virtually no second level to speak of. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Viña Honda,81,12.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Red Blend,Bodegas Silvano Garcia
148035,148035,Spain,"Rusty in color, with nutty, leathery aromas that feature little to no fruit. Quite sour in the mouth, and drying on the finish. Just not that pleasant; it's definitely not what you'd expect from Merlot. Imported by North American Beverage Group.",Masia Freyes Collección Especial,81,30.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Merlot,Vallformosa
148036,148036,Spain,"Jumbled, jammy and disjointed, with a heavy load of extracted, overdone fruit. Deep and hard, with funky aromas and a disconcerting mouthfeel. A wine with issues. Imported by VinLozano Imports.",Reserva,81,20.0,Northern Spain,Toro,,Tinta de Toro,Viñalcasta
148038,148038,Spain,"Balsamic vinegar, burnt coffee and pepper aromas create a bouquet that's more like salad dressing than fine wine. The flavors are peppery and herbal, yet the body is full and the mouthfeel not bad. A blend of four grapes, led by Garnacha and Tempranillo. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",Tinto Joven,80,11.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Red Blend,Señorio de Aylés
148039,148039,Spain,"Mulchy and earthy from start to finish, with distant flavors that barely register. Not overly bad but a true cipher of a wine. Imported by Kensington Distributors Inc.",Superior,80,9.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Tempranillo,Torre Oria
148040,148040,Spain,"Foxy, animal aromas don't distinguish it, while robust but mulchy berry and plum flavors fail to take it very far. Barely acceptable. Imported by Grapes of Spain.",,80,10.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,,Garnacha,Señorio de Aylés
148279,148279,Spain,"Light and lemony, with a hint of green astringency. Tangerine with hints of mushroom on the palate run toward a solid but lean finish. Has zest but little roundness. Fresh and crisp, but not the most friendly bubbly.",Brut Nature Reserva de la Familia,86,22.0,Catalonia,Cava,,White Blend,Juvé y Camps
148283,148283,Spain,"Not every wine is easy to read: this one is a case in point. The nose offers sweet toffee and apricot, while the palate starts out toasty and dry before unveiling ripe peach and brown sugar. The dosage on this wine is unusual. A funky bubbly that's worth a try.",Cuvée Dessert Dulce,86,20.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Pinot Noir,Parxet
148360,148360,Spain,"Licorice, pepper and raisin join forces on a can't-miss bouquet that's all Monastrell and all southern Spain. Dark and candied, with tons of cooked brown sugar. This is what you'd call big and tannic, with a hard, grabby mouthfeel. One glass we can recommend; two or more might be tough to handle.",Dulce,86,24.0,Levante,Jumilla,,Monastrell,Bodegas Silvano Garcia
148369,148369,Spain,"Loud and basic, with ripe fruit aromas and flavors but also a detectable heaviness. The palate pushes ripe apple and pear, while the finish is big but quiet. Deep and dense but dull along the edges.",Gran Cuvée,86,18.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Gramona
148536,148536,Spain,"Avinyo does not make cookie-cutter cavas, and thus this wine is out of the ordinary and not always the better for it. The nose is lean and spritzy, with aromas equal to lemon-lime. The palate is drawn in for a brut, with tart flavors. Slim in profile, but not a bad or indifferent wine.",Brut Reserva,85,16.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Avinyó
148638,148638,Spain,"Dusty cherry aromas start out full and turn more green and grassy with time. Sweet grapefruit and tang carry the palate, and the finish is a rush of acidity. Good but odd.",Chantal Brut Rosé,85,20.0,Catalonia,Cava,,White Blend,Vallformosa
148645,148645,Spain,"Full and heavy, with mango and orange juice flavors. Creamy in the mouth, with a full, foamy feel. Good citrus and apple characteristics keep it moving forward, while the weight is definitely there. Good in cava cocktails or as a Spanish mimosa.",Brut,85,11.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Sparkling Blend,Paul Cheneau
149059,149059,Spain,"Shows yeasty, earthy, dusty aromas, with just a slight trace of fruit. There are also mild fruity flavors. It's slightly sweet as a semi-seco should be, but has adequate acidity and decent length finishing with some richness.",Semi Seco Reserva,86,9.0,Catalonia,Penedès,,Champagne Blend,Jaume Serra
149240,149240,Spain,"With its dried-cherry and rose-petal aromas and flavors, this beautiful, mature red is every bit the equivalent of a fine, older Bordeaux or Burgundy. Cumin and cinnamon show on the palate and the refined finish is lovely, with anise and white pepper accents.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,94,185.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149242,149242,Spain,"The bouquet of dried cherries, plums, prunes and tobacco opens to a palate of dense fruit that's dry and structured. This wine is big, but even textured and not heavy. Shows finely focused fruit and good grip. The dark fruit flavors add spice accents on the long finish. Cellar Selection.",Rioja Gran Reserva,92,75.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Campillo
149245,149245,Spain,"Deep, sweet dark-cherry fruit forms a solid foundation for this impressive wine. There's a touch of menthol oak on the nose; plenty of leather and earth accents in the mouth, coupled with good acidity, keep the palate complex and lively. Finishes long, with full—but not harsh—tannins. Editors' Choice.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,92,26.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149247,149247,Spain,"Beautifully balanced, this shows all the positive attributes of mature Rioja. Though 30 years old, it is still very alive, with deep sweet fruit that wears tobacco and meat accents. Anise accents the ultrasmooth palate. Full of complex flavors, with a lingering finish.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,92,125.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149330,149330,Spain,"Nose of ripe spicy fruit with tobacco and earth accents. Similar full, chewy flavors ride the plush mouthfeel. The long finish is dense and dark.",Rioja Reserva,90,24.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Campillo
149429,149429,Spain,"This is classic Rioja Reserva, with textbook cherry, earth, leather and meaty Tempranillo flavors supported by a good acid spine and moderate tannins. The elegant finish is dry and spicy.",Faustino V Riserva,89,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149510,149510,Spain,"Sweet cherry and dried-rose notes on the nose are offset by some noticeable barnyardy scents. Elegant, but less generous on the palate and decidedly drier than the much older 1970, this finishes with dry tannins.",Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva,89,72.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149601,149601,Spain,"Toasty oak and tobacco shadings are wrapped around the dark-cherry fruit core of this 100% Tempranillo wine. The full and supple palate shows good depth of fruit, leather and spice accents. This handsome modern-style Rioja finishes long and tangy, with moderate tannins.",Rioja Crianza,88,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Faustino
149819,149819,Spain,"This pleasant wine shows clean apple, hay and mildly floral aromas. Even and round on the tongue, it has a slightly waxy feel and decent acidity. Green apple, citrus and slightly nutty flavors play on the finish, with a crisp, dry grapefruity aftertaste that lingers. Best Buy.",,86,7.0,Central Spain,Tierra Manchuela,,Viura,Santana
149858,149858,Spain,"Dried cherry and spice aromas and flavors accented by peppery, meaty notes mark this joven (young wine). A blend of 80% Tempranillo and 20% Mazuela, it has a light, even mouthfeel. The acids are tangy, and a little prickly now, and the bright finish shows spicy elements.",Faustino VII,86,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Bodegas Faustino
149936,149936,Spain,"A straightforward basic red, with dried cherry, oak and slightly meaty scents. The palate shows dark fruit and spice flavors, medium weight and an even texture. Finishes with decent length and tangy, spicy notes.",,84,7.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Tempranillo,Santana
149993,149993,Spain,"This Rioja rose displays a full bouquet of rose petal, spice and the slightly meaty element that Tempranillo so often shows. No White Zinfandel, this is a fairly lean and dry wine with spicy notes, a decent match for hors d'oeuvres or light meals.",Faustino V Rosado,84,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Rosé,Bodegas Faustino
